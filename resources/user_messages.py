migrateToSlashCommands = """Hello everyone!
As part of our promise for continued improvement, we have made the choice to move away from prefix-based commands (`!help`, for example).
Slash commands have significantly better support, run much faster, and are way more convenient. No more command conflicts!

As part of this change, we are **phasing out** prefix-based commands. They may work for now, but we reserve the right to remove them unexpectedly!
Instead, use the brand-new *slash commands*. In your chat box, type `/` and look for Fritz's profile picture. If you click/tap on it, you'll be able to see all available commands.

Not only does this make it easier to see what commands are available, it also makes it easier to fill out different command parameters, without needing quotes!
That's right, you don't need quotes anymore~ Just make sure to use the slash commands, not prefix commands.

Thanks,
- Void Kitty & Fritz"""

final_migration_warning = """Hello again!
As we previously mentioned, prefix commands have been depricated in favour of slash commands.

Unfortunately for legacy users, today is the day... We're sunsetting prefix-based commands completely. If you haven't learned about slash commands, read [this article](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ>) by Discord to get started.

Shortly after this message is sent out, Fritz will be shut down for a short while to initiate the migration. After the bot comes back online, prefix commands ***will no longer respond***.

Thanks for your continued support! <3
- Void Kitty & Fritz"""
