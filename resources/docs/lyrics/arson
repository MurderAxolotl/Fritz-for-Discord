I really hate you, stop getting in my way
I've lost my patience, when are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out just like my broken TV
If you come back once more, it shall be painful, you'll see
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire
It's almost over, why can't you just let it fly?
Don't be afraid, it's not the first time you'll die
Your mechanical parts click, sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance, I won't leave you alone, oh yeah
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire
I hope you die in a fire
