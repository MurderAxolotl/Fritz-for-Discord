{William Afton, 10:00 AM} 
What’s the best way to commit murder? This question often found its way into his head. He grinned as he though on that. It would have to be the knife; the feeling of the blade slipping into the victim… The feeling of them squirming… Being right there… Seeing the look in their eyes as they realized that you had bested them. Yes, the knife was the best way. 
William approached what was supposed to be a happy place. Today, however, it would be a sadistic place. He found himself around the building, breathing deeply. He searched for the back door before finding it a minute later. He slid it open silently, slipping inside and closing it behind him. He walked further into the dark hall, finding the storage closet. He eased it open and slipped into the dark room. He closed the door silently and flicked the light on. He was met with the familiar face of SpringBonnie. He grinned, reaching a hand out towards the golden fabric, breathing in deeply as his hand made contact. He stepped forwards, gently grasping it. He lifted, locking the springlocks inside into place. He slid the head over his own. He looked around for a moment, spotting the rest of the suit. No. Not a suit. A skin. He spotted the rest of the skin, waking over calmly. One did not rush a murder. One was supposed to take pleasure in slowly killing. He slid into the skin, fabric popping as it stretched. He breathed deeper. It was time.
He walked back towards the door, spring in his step a little more noticeable. He opened the door, stepping into the hall and turning towards the sound of playing children, dining families, and the clanking of food plates, cups, and pitchers. He danced out into the open, as if nothing were about to happen. He heard the sound of children laughing and clapping. Sounds of joy. He danced over to one lonely-looking kid. He stopped dancing in front of the child. He looked down, kneeling to go eye-to-eye with the little one.
With a smooth and melodic voice, he asked the child, “Why are you out here, away from the safety of friends?” It was not a question of a friendly nature, but to the child, he would seem caring. When the child least expected it, William could lead her away from the prying eyes of the dining families, towards the back room, and then he would have his opportunity.
{Susie}
Susie stared longingly at the other kids. She separated herself from them, thinking they were having a better time away from her sulking.
She looked up, and saw Spring Bonnie crouching next to her. She jumped a little. Then, it spoke to her. “Why are you out here, away from the safety of friends?” The question caught her by surprise. She knew the answer, but didn't want to verbalize it. “I just wanted some time alone, that's all.”
(William Afton}
William cocked his head slightly. “Oh. What happened?”
{Susie} 
Susie wanted to lie, but then she thought It's just an animatronic. Telling it the truth won't hurt! "Well, my dog died, and I don't want to ruin the mood for them!” 
{William Afton}
William blinked. Hmm. This girl seemed to be genuinely upset about losing an animal. He didn’t understand why; he’d killed puppies for fun. He loved watching them drown in their own blood… But that’s not what he needed to be thinking about. Watching this girl bleed out would be much more satisfying. Which meant he needed to seem compassionate, even if he didn’t truly have that capacity. “Oh no! I’m sorry for your loss. Would you like a hug?” He twitched. He didn’t see the point in this. It made him feel all tingly. This wasn’t what he was here to do, but if it made the bloodbag trust him, he’d suffer through it.
{Susie} 
Susie wanted to refuse, ‘cause hugging an animatronic sounded… weird. But… a hug sounded nice. And SpringBonnie looks… huggable? Questioning her sanity, she hugged it. She cringed a little. She was freaking hugging an animatronic! 
{William Afton}
He flinched slightly. The child actually hugged him? Unthinkable. Yet here he was, getting hugged by a child. However, he would deal with this just as long as he needed to. Once the girl trusted him… Just thinking about it gave him a sadistic satisfaction. He would get what he came here for. “Is there anything else you would like to talk about?” The words left a sour taste in his mouth. Had he said that? Yes, he had. Unfortunate that this girl wasn’t as stupid as some of the others.
{Susie} 
Susie thought about that for a second. “I mean, other than the fact that I just hugged a robot and am probably going insane? Not really, no.” 
{William Afton}
So the girl did think of him as a robot. Good. She didn’t know - didn’t expect - what would happen to her. “Hey.. I have a present for you. Do you like presents?” If he could lure this girl to the back room…
{Susie}
The pain of losing her dog was long forgotten, replaced with happiness. "I do like presents!” 
{William Afton}
William’s grin widened. Fortunately, this girl couldn’t see that. The skin hid his gruesome face from her. He slowly stood, motioning for the child to follow as he walked towards the back room.”I hid it from the other children so they couldn’t take it...”
{Susie} 
Spring Bonnie hid it? Sounds like I have to find it? That would be fun! She followed, excited to play seeker. 
{William Afton}
He opened the door to the storage closet. It wasn’t a dinky little thing like you might think it was, it expanded for a good two hundred feet, with plenty of shelves for storage, and a separate room for costumes. He truly could have hid something here. However, he had not cared enough to buy a present for someone he was planning on killing anyways. Nor had he gone through the effort of raiding the gift shop. He just didn’t care enough. “I hid it in here. Can you find it?”
{Susie} 
“I'm not sure, but I can try!” She smiled, and began searching through the dusty boxes. She let out a little sneeze as some dust flew up to her face. 
{William Afton}
William didn’t have time to let the girl search for long. After a minute of her searching happily, he slowly slipped a knife out from the suit while she was distracted rummaging through a box. He crept forward silently, coming up behind her. “Here’s your present..” His voice was no longer the soft and smooth voice of Spring Bonnie, it was now the rough and deep voice of William Afton. He pressed the knife into her back, twisting it roughly, feeling it slip inside. He grinned with a sadistic satisfaction. He slid it up to her neck, not letting any blood pool out. He roughly yanked it to the side, leaving a jagged cut across the child’s neck. He stepped back after plunging the knife through her back and into her little heart. Before he let go, he felt the weak, rhythmic pulse of the heart slow against the blade.
He let her go, the limp body dropping to the floor. He’d have to find a way to hide that in a minute, but for now, this would work. He had noticed a child out front, all alone…
He made sure that there wasn’t any blood on the skin, easing the door open and entering the hall once again. He danced back out and towards the door. Once there, he stuck his head out, looking for the kid. He spotted the child and whispered, “Hey. I need your help. Someone’s hurt.” His own voice had once again turned to that melodic soothing and soft voice.
He grinned. Another body in the bag...
TIME SKIP- MAY COME BACK TO THIS SHIT ANOTHER TIME-  for now lets just say shit went back to normal because Chica would shut the psychopaths down, stick a sign on them, and yeet them at the front door- and that is how the rest of the time is handled- then Mango went beserk-
{Day Guard Jereshit), 8:30 AM}
Oh god oh god oh god oh god… His thoughts dissolved into chaos as he stared at the vent in fear, the sound of electrostatic interference hissing through the air, crackling loudly. Reaching for the camera tablet and bringing up the vent, he kept his eyes on said vent.  A moment later, his radio crackled, saying ‘Hey guard, y’know where the Mangleofucker thing is? The kids are bored.’ and startling him enough to drop the damned tablet.
It crawled out of the vent.
He knew he was fucked.
‘Mangle,’ as it was called, climbed up the wall, staring down at him for a couple of seconds, before…
He never found out what was supposed to happen next, considering how he died in a mere second.
To think that he had promised his kid he’d bring him to this place on his birthday.
Well, fuck.
Oh, there go the lights...
Blablabla… this place shuts down, the Toys get scrapped, and the Withereds are repaired or something- Shadow Bonnie can go burn in hell-
FNaF 1
{Mike Schmit (really Afton, but we dont talk about that)} 
Stepping over the debris- and landing on some gum, which caused him to gag -Mike slipped on a puddle of soda (Pepsi, from the looks of it) and whammed into the wall with a thunk.
Great way to start the night.
Groaning, he fell forward into the tiny office, sliding down the wall with another thunk.
God damn it.
He stood and stumbled over to the chair, collapsed into it, and sighed.
No, he wasn’t drunk.
Just a little tired.
‘Little’ being an understatement, in this case.
He shut the doors and faceplanted into the desk.
Let’s just take an hour-long nap...
{Phone Bitch}
“Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?
Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, "Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.
Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.
So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?
Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.
Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.”
Mike is staring at the phone in annoyance. No sleep. Right, the doors. He pressed the buttons next to said doors, watching them smoothly drop into the ground, then watched in astonishment as small floor panels slid up and covered the gap where the door now hid.
That was new to him.
Cool though.
Bonus, it was quick.
Could be helpful.
Footsteps are yes - MIKENOTICETHESOUNDS-
Mike looks out into the hall, nopes the fuck out of the hall, and closes the door.
What the fu-
Wait.
Didn’t that dude say something about freeroam?
Not cool.
Great.
Right, Foxy. The camera is now on Foxy, who is peeking his head out of the curtain.
Bonnie just sittin at the door- how nice of him- 
Mike is on the ground hyperventilating. Fuck fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck- calm I’m calm I’m calm, I’m calm, I’M CALM.
Stay Calm starts playing somewhere in the pizzashitplace-
Mike is having an argument with himself for a couple of minutes before he calms down enough to check the door.
Bonnie fucked off because he got bored-
Door is now open.
Mike decides to be creative and is now hunting for parts around the room. He has found almost all of them. Of course, he’s missing two. He looks out the door, debating whether or not it would be a good idea to go out there and find said parts.
Probably not.
But he needed those parts.
He walked back over to the shitty computer - which he would be upgrading later - and checked the building layout. Parts and Service was clear on the other side of the building. And all the stages were in clear sight of the doorway. And there was only one exit.
Great.
EMP?
Probably wouldn’t work.
The damned Animatronics were probably EMPS proof.
Time to do some sketchy shit- dodaaaaaadodaaaaaaa- hope I get away with it- ooh- tHeRe iS a HoOm iN tHe OfFiCe- imma just peek through the window now- 
Mike hears a click from the right side and gets the feeling he’s being watched.
Close the door?
Yeah.
Close the door.
Mike presses the button.
Door slides up from the ground.
Click.
Yes.
Okay.
Good.
Did that bitch just- iTs nOt LiKe I wAs GoIn iN- hMmMmMm- have I seen him before?
“NO!” Mike screeched, tapping away.
Oh right there were other animatronics to be worried about.
Wait- why did he say no? Not like im talking out loud- am I?
“You are. And I’m having a conversation with an animatronic. This is fine. Perfectly normal.”
O-o Alright then- I am Chica- 
“Hello. I’m Mike. Do you need anything?” For the love of god don’t open the door.
Um- just curious- 
“Okay.” Oh good the camera went down.
Foxy.
Oh shit.
Oi, guard? You paying any attention to me?
The camera's off.
OiOiOiOiOiOiOiOIOIoIoIoIoIOiOiOIOii.
I’m COMIN” IN-
Foxy shush- Im having a conversation- take a chill pill- if you dont leave I will literally dismantle you-
Mike has commit yelp and has tried to close the door.
Foxy is standing on the door panels.
Door cannot close.
Foxy is looking at Chica through the window.
Meh. I’m just gonna sit here.
Foxy is now sitting on the ground.
Mike is just staring at the animatronic.
Weren’t they supposed to like try to kill him?
Just don’t mention-
Don’t mention anything-
“C-can I help you??”
Stutter.
Ugh.
wHaTs GoIn oN hErE- Bonnie has joined the battle-
More yelping. “Hi?”
Oh dear god- we are gonna give the nightguard a panik attack- we haven't had one that even entered the office without freaking out in a long time-
Stumbling backwards, and gasping for breath, Mike stared at the animatronics in fear. Not even realizing he wasn’t breathing, he slid to the ground, subconsciously struggling to take in a breath of sweet air, 
Oh Foxy- you are really in for it now-
Oh right.
Foxy.
Mike is now hugging Foxy.
Bonnie and Chica just starin like “tf-”
Mike is feeling better now, but continues hugging the fox.
Foxy is just staring down at Mike, then up and Bonnie, then over to Chica with a look of ‘What the fuck get this maniac off of me.’
Chica stares back at him with a look of “if you ruin this precious moment you will lose your cursing abilities- and Afton will hunt you down AGAIN-”
Mike chooses to ignore that.
Foxy has given up and is now awkwardly patting Mike with his hand.
Bonnie committed “fuckthisshitimout”
Chica takes a picture- dont ask how- 
Foxy is glaring at Chica.
Mike has released the poor animatronic and is now poking at the computer.
Foxy is relieved.
That was adorable- Foxy you should do that with children more often-
Foxy is actually - worryingly - considering taking her up on that-
I never got your name guard- w h a t  i s  y o u r  n a m e 
Mike has frozen.
“Mike Schmit.”
kewl-
“I’m going to go get some parts from P&S, be right back…
I’d be careful- Bonnie is salty right now-
Mike is slowly going down the hall, watching for the salty bunny.
Foxy is silently following him. Just in case.
Chica is quickly goin back down the hall- 
Mike does a smart, sprints back to the office, opens door, then sprints back to Foxy.
I could have done that for you. I’m like 5x as fast as you.
Chica rushes to follow-
I think he knows that Foxy- stop bragging about it- makes me feel slow-
Sorry.
Freddy is on the stage listening to- you guessed it - Discord.
Foxy stares at the bear.
Said bear looks over to Foxy, grins- Mike has commit yelp -and then turns back to Spotify.
I still wonder how he got wifi out here.
Its okey- Freddy is the leader of the band- he needs to do SOMETHING other than play one song all the time- I just wish he’d share the secrets with me-
“True.”
But he won’t share the wifi password with ussssss-
FREDDY- PLEASE JUST TELL US YOUR SECRETS-
But then I would need to upgrade the wifi, which would cost an additional 8 dollars a month.
YoUrE aN aNiMAtRonIC- Animatronics dont pay bills- 
No, but it comes out of the guard’s pocket. Uh, that is, the day guard’s pocket.
I dont even know that guy’s name-
Exactly.
Mike is in P&S looking for shit.
Foxy is at the door watching the chaos.
WhAt ArE yOu DoIn iN mAh SwAmP?
Yelp.
Foxy has not noticed, as Freddy is now blasting Up and Down, much to the annoyance of Foxy.
If you dont switch that to Die in a Fire I steh- I will tell the dayguard to stop paying for the wifi-
Die in a fire is now playing.
“Hi??? I’m just looking for parts-”
… fine- Bonnie was mostly salty about Freddy playing Up and Down-
Freddy has taken it to the next level and is now playing Beat Saber. Yes, since he’s an animatronic, he can just throw himself into a VR environment.
Foxy is attempting to figure out how to start Beat Saber, but since the wifi only supports one person, he can’t.
He’s salty about that.
Chica is gonna pull a big brain and turn off Freddy.
Mike has found the parts he needs and has thrown them into his backpack which he found in P&S. Swinging it on his back, he waved goodbye to Bonnie and has walked out, and is now staring out the chaos in the main room.
Welcome to the chaos, Mike. Foxy mumbled, mentally fiddling with the wifi. Would you happen to know the wifi password?
“No?”
Damn.
Freddy- tell us the wifi password or I'm grounding you for a month.
Bonnie walked out and is staring at a poster
I figured out- its Freddy Fazbear-
Idiot- thats the logo for the pizzeria-
Foxy attempts to enter said password. Fails.
Yeah that’s not the password.
“Haha you’ll never guess the password.”
Foxy attempts.
Foxy succeeds.
WHATS THE PASSWORD- if it’s password-
“The password is literally ‘Haha you’ll never guess the password.’”
… wow- Thats really creative-
Chica/Bonnie enter said password- 
Freddy’s gonna be pissed when he gets back.
When did Freddy leave?
Foxy points is hook at Freddy, who is slumped over, very much turned off.
Mike suddenly has a very, very bad feeling-
The building’s lights are flickering now, some gold, some cold.
Chica and Bonnie look unbothered-
Mike suddenly gets the feeling that his life is in danger.
Golden Freddy steps out of the shadows, air around him ice cold.
Also known as, the temperature in the building just dropped 20 degrees.
Yeah, his life’s in danger.
Golden Freddy is looking at Mike, eyes cold and calculating.
Hai Golden! Meet Mike! Hes the first night guard since… ya know who- to actually make it to the office without running out of the room- also the first to talk to us- as equalish things-
Hello, Michael. Slight grin.
Oh fuck was the first thing to cross through his mind.
Foxy’s entire demeanor has changed from light and friendly to hostile and murderous.
Golden? Foxeh? Ya gud? 
Both of them simultaneously hissed, Michael Afton.
… It’s Mike Sch… sch- how- Mike- how do you say it?
“Schmit.” Mike mumbled, stepping sideways away from Foxy, who is currently only being kept from killing him by Golden Freddy.
Yeah, in danger.
Mike Schmit. 
Deceit. Michael, did you really expect to be able to… waltz in without me noticing?
Bonnie quickly steps in. Hey- maybe they just share a last name- I doubt he would still look this young- he actually looks younger-
Mike is feverently wishing that he can somehow survive this.
Golden Freddy shifts his icy gaze over to Bonnie.
Golden- dont let this end badly again- 
Freddy has reactivated.
Golden Freddy is looking at Mike again. Have anything to say, Afton?
Mike quickly - too quickly - shakes his head.
Golden- cut it out! There is no way in  h e l l  that is William.
No, it isn’t William… but his son. It’s the next best thing… William in the basement, unable to help as we slowly torture this one to death. And since he isn’t springlock-
Ignore that last part.
And? If my dad were a killer, that wouldnt mean I am one as well, right? And killing him just because hes his son would make us no better than William-
Mike has broken into a run-
Golden Reddy is watching him run to the office.
Dammit Golden- you scared him away.
Cold stare.
Not. Cool. 
Golden Freddy is wondering how to make them see the danger Michael poses.
Chica decides to try and do the opposite.
Wanna see a cute picture of Michael and Foxy?
Foxy is back to normal. Don’t you dare.
I. Dare. 
Foxy is looking from Golden Freddy to Chica and back.
Chica walks up to Golden Freddy, watching Foxy the entire time.
Golden Freddy is watching Chica with interest.
Foxy is struggling.
Chica shows the picture of Michael hugging Foxy to Golden with a big smirk on her face.
Foxy is dying.
S M I R K
Your chicken has a death wish. Foxy hisses.
Freddy is watch
I am nobody’s chicke- DID YOU BREAK THE WALL?
Foxy gives Chica an eyebrow. Not that you know of.
Anyways- this was adorable- Mike was having a panik attack- I got mad at Foxy, then Mike hugged Foxy! It seems Foxy is Mike’s favorite.
We’re goin’ off the rails on the crazy train~ Golden Freddy has commit mumble.
I- just- tell me if you think thats adorable- me and Bonnie do-
Golden Freddy reluctantly nods.
Foxy is dying even more.
If you show this side of you to kids more often- you- well- you are still gonna be the favorite- you’ve been the favorite- TwT
I’m in the corner of the room, with almost no light. FAVOURITE?
Yep- you are literally everyone’s favorite. 
What little good that did for Alec-
Uh. Golden Freddy is now staring at Foxy.
I mean- who the hell is Alec?
Better.
mUmBlE- its his fault- he was being a bitch on his sister’s birthday-
True.
The air is now another 5 degrees colder.
Golden- can you not? Its getting cold- 
We’ve agreed that I’m the one who’s supposed to break the wall.
Pretty much- yeah-
Golden Freddy is annoyed.
Mike is almost done setting up the doors to be automatic. Power conservation. Wire here, wire there, battery here, random animatronic eyeball there-
Miniature fire there-
Fire extinguisher here-
How’s that kid you cursed?
Probably not so good. I hear they stole his arm and eye. I’m magical that way.
… Im grounding you. 
Foxy is just staring at the chicken.
No Beat Saber until you find a way to make up. Idc if you never do. You are grounded until then.
Foxy goes back in time for a second, gives the kid a swift kick in the ass, then comes back. No dying now. Foxy is now playing Beat Saber.
I- i guess that works-
Foxy grins, then ducks to the ground. Stupid walls. BLOCKBLOCKBLOCK- rapid slicing occurs.
Mike has connected the Automation wires to the computer, which has automation wires connected to the door control panel… which has power wires running to the batteries, which also has power cables running to the automation sensors outside the door...
… imma just check on Mike- you’re weirder than me when I lose Carl- Chica is now walking down the wrong hallway-
One automation sensor is quietly beeping now.
Mike is looking up at the computer, which essentially said:
[MOTION DETECTED]
[OH SHIT]
[THE FUCKIN’ ANIMATRONIC’S ABOUT A QUARTER DOWN THE HALLWAY]
It didn’t actually say that, but that’s what it felt like… 
Chica is at the door
Automation sensor is beeping quickly now. Door automatically slams closed.
Happy Mike.
eXcUsE mE?!
“Oh, it’s automatic.” typing.
… can ya please oPeN-
Automation sensor beeps four times quickly, twice slowly, then four times quickly. Door opens. “Come on in. it’ll close in 7 seconds.”
Quick running in-
“Careful not to trip on all the wires, please.” Door slams shut again.
Im more concerned about how you did all this in one night-
“The computer had a lot of the code already.” Computer beeping.
… well- maybe keep that away from ykw- he wouldnt like knowing you know how to do this- I barely convinced him you’re not a security threat by showing him the picture of you and Foxy-
“It barely works. If it gets triggered too many times in a row the processer will blow out.” Mike points to the janky-ass processer setup on the back wall, with plenty of flashing indicators. “But I won’t let him see it.”
Also- a little warning- Golden doesnt usually come out on his own- you usually have to summon him- so- dont summon him-
“Okay.” Automation sensor beeping rapidly.
Banging on the door.
Oh hi there Foxy!
Can I come in?
“Yes.” typing, beeping, door opening, explanation, Foxy entering, door closing, more beeping. Mike is squished against one wall at this point. Damned office is too small for two animatronics and a human.
Chica gives him a look that warns him to not try anything- trust level 0-
Foxy gives her an of course not look.
S m i l e- 
“Don’t kick the batteries!” Mike yelps and catches it before it falls over.
Foxy makes a ‘sorry sorry’ noise.
How long until the night ends?
Mike points to the clock - which has many wires coming out of it - which says ‘0:00 OH OW oooooo.’
… tf- did you break the clock?
“Probably.”
I- I have no words- im 90% sure you’re gonna have to pay for all this-
“Meh. It probably shouldn't be broken.”
… no- no it should not be broken- it should N E V E R  be broken- wHy dId YoU eVeN nEeD iT-
“I needed a quartz crystal and i didn’t want to break the clock.”
I- you- oh for the love of Henry-
“I’m not Henry.”
HowdoyouknowHenry-
“WillIAm dRAGGed mE-” voice crack.
Ya gud?
“Yes.”
Where did William drag you?
“-tO thEIr HoUSe- at least Charlie was gone-”
Wait. What about Charlie?
“Nothing.” Mike looks at the clock, unplugs a wire, plugs it back in, and boops a button. Clock works now.
Well it cant be  n o t h i n g. Why is it good that Charlie was gone? Where did Charlie go? 
“It doesn’t matter.”
It does matter. T e l l  m e-
“I don’t like her that much.” Clock is now beeping.
Chica is questioning whether to say what she wants to say or not- sHe gOnNa SaY iT- Do you know what happened to her?
Mike is quietly making the clock stop beeping. Clock is now fixed.
Is that going to far?
“What?”
I was just curious if you knew what happened to her.
“I am not aware of what happened to her.”
When was the last time you saw her?
“No idea.”
Foxy is just watching them, back and forth, back and forth.
Lets just say- your father is- dIsGuStInG-
Mike is silently contemplating his existence.
Sorry- that sounded rude-
Mike is ignoring the comment. Clock is now flashing, ‘Please oh god help me’ over and over again.
Why is the clock-
Don’t ask. Foxy mumbled.
Too late- am asking
Clock is now flashing, ‘Someone get this bitch’s fingers out of my head.’
“I might have accidentally made it sentient.”
Chica stares at the clock- alarmed and curious- then confused- Hold up- how did you do that? 
Gestures towards the processer in the back of the room.
… at least it ain’t like us-
Disconnects wires. Clock is now flashing the time.
[3:00]
HOW- ITS ONLY BEEN ONE HOURRR?!
“What?”
ALL THIS HAPPENED- IN ONE HOUR-
“IT’s 3:00 AM- oh.”
Here I was thinkin the night was almost over-
“Oh?”
Freddy is currently changing the wifi password.
Golden Freddy is cracking said passwords immediately.
Bonnie is just trying to update the playlists-
Foxy is remotely switching Bonnie’s songs from stuff he likes to stuff that he doesn’t like.
FOXY I WILL SLAP YOU-
You can’t get to me. Up and Down.
Bitch-
Miss YOU! is now playing.
THATS IT! IM GOING TO TELL THE DAYGUARD TO STOP PAYING FOR SPOTIFYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY-
Doors suddenly open. “Oh f-” *rapid button pressing.*
Bonnie is already at the door, staring down Foxy.
Door slides up slowly.
Bonnie is already inside. Foxy~
Foxy is attempting to open other door. Door is refusing to open. Processor is currently crying. Mike is trying to override the security lockdown. Shit is broken.
Oh Foxy. You better fix it, or I will make sure you dont have Beat Saber ever again.
Doors slide open. Foxy is poof. Doors close again. Playlist is fixed, but White Tee is playing.
eYe TwItCh
Oh Mike. Please let me out. A certain Foxy needs to be punished. Imma see if I can get GF to take his Wifi access away.
Mike is typing away furiously. Doors are sparking.
You are about to break the doors- i steh if you break the doors-
“The doors will be fine.” Doors are clearly not fine as they open.
Ohdeargod-
“The doors are fine.” smoke filling the air.
We should probably run-
“No, that’s from the processer back there.” points at the smoking processer. “That’s gonna be a pain to fix.”
I think im gonna run-
Chica and Bonnie run-
Mike sets to work fixing all his stuff.
Bonnie sees Foxy, and immediately runs at him.
Flash flash. Blink. Beep. Automation noises.
Foxy~ We werent done talking yet~
Foxy has yelped. I fixed it!
Golden Freddy is looking down the hallway quizzically. Anyone know what’s going on down there?
Mike’s doing stuff. Dunno what though.
I’m tempted to go check.
That wouldn’t be-
-a good idea. Something I’ve heard all my… life. I don’t give a shit. Golden Freddy has begun his slow walk down the hall.
Mike has fixed his magic shit and it is all working now.
Golden Freddy is at the door.
Doors slam shut in his face.
Golden Freddy is now worried.
Chica rushes over, seeing Golden go down the hall. Sorry- hes trying to make improvements- abouttimetoo-
“I shouldn’t open the door, should I?”
Golden Freddy gives him a ‘what do you think’ look.
If you wanna say hi to Golden, then sure-
Typing noise ensues. Door slides open.
Golden steps in and is just staring at the mass of wires everywhere.
Like I said- I m p r o o o o o o v e m e n t s
Clearly.
Welcome to the big brain room. Where Foxy almost died again-
Door automatically closes behind them.
Golden Freddy gives Chica a ‘Told you he was a threat’ look.
Mike is oblivious, as he is continuing to upgrade things
Chica rolls her eyes at GF, cause he's being ridiculous. 
The floodlamps just outside the door flicker on briefly before going out again.
Alright then- that is not concerning AT ALL-
“I’m just hooking all these systems up to the automation grid… don’t mind me.”
Golden Freddy is giving off freeze waves.
GOLDEN IM GETTING COLD- 
“This tech is heat sensitive. Could you perhaps, keep it r-”
DO NOT TELL ME WHAT TO DO, MORTAL.
Blink.
Okay Golden- I think you may be salty- Maybe we get outta here for a little bit-
Door automatically opens.
Chica walks to the doorway, and waits for Golden to follow.
Golden huffs and walks out, leaving a small trail of ice behind him.
Damn- didnt know you were that icy Freddy i’ve been seeing-
Foxy is simply attempting to fucking beat Up and Down on Beat Saber and FUCKING FAILING and HE”S BEEN DOING THIS FOR HOURS NOW AND HE KEEPS ONLY GETTING TO THE FUCKING NOODLE BLOCKS AND IT’S DRIVING HIM INSANE. Then he’s pissed when the wifi dies.
WHO KILLED THE WIFI?!?
Wasn’t me.
Nor me.
That would probably be whoever is resetting the wifi-
“That would be me.” Mike.
Annoyed fox noises.
Eh- at least you get a break-
Foxy is now on the ground struggling to catch his- animatronics don’t breathe… but this one does- but like, IF THEY”RE ANIMATRONICS- THE NIGHTMARES- NFIUASIUDJA LOGIC- breath.
Has Beat Saber really taken over your undead life?
No. Waves to his experiments on his stage.
Wifi briefly turns on, then blinks out again.
Annoyed fox noises.
Annoyed Mike noises.
Pissed GF noises.
Confused bear noises.
Vibing bunny noises.
Facepalming chican nugget noises.
Foxy is vibing with Bonnie.
Golden Freddy is wondering how this has happened.
Freddy is in a rage- he was on the leaderboard of Warbots.io when the wifi went dead.
Mike has electrocuted himself~ and he’s fine~
Bonnie moves the vibe party closer to Freddy so he can stop raging
Vibing bear.
Wifi is somewhat alive again… but it’s 18x faster right now...
Bonnie turns up the music so the entire building can hear.
Mike vibing while trying to not electrocute himself be like oWo. Wifi is back to normal, by the way. ‘cept it’s super-duper ultrafast and costs 85 dollars a month.
Nobody is noticing the wifi is back cause they all vibing to I Cant Fix You- 
All of the smartspeakers in the building chime up with ‘wireless connection succeeded. Connecting to Spotify player.’ moments later they’re all simultaneously and in sync blasting I Can’t Fix You.
Shit happens, night ends, whatever, phone guy fuck off-
Phone Guy: I will not fuck off thank you- I am forever here- haunting the phone- 
Night two~
Golden Freddy is seriously wondering if he should call in a favour from SF at this point.
Foxy is sleep~ stayed up all day playing Beat Saber in the back room~
Chica bout to kick his ass- hE wAs SuPpOSeD tO hUg ChIlDrEn-
F o x y- F O X Y-
What~ I’m AWAKE AWHATSNAI what~
Did you hug the children today?
No-
And why not?
I was busy.
Doing  w h a t?
… Beat Saber-
… mhm … 
DOn’t kill me~
Chica has to decide 1 of 2 things. But first, she powers Foxy off so he cant run away.
So- Remove his access to Beat Saber, or make sure he hugs children tomorrow- why not both?
So she removes his access to Beat Saber and will make sure he hugs the children tomorrow. 
Foxy is annoyed in his sleep~ turns on.
So you gonna hug children tomorrow?
Brief pause. N-y-n-y-n-yes-
Good. Now- if you are lying- I will break your other “experiments” 
Foxy has made a defensive hissing noise. TOUCH THEM AND DIE.
Oh how I wish I could.
Could what?
Mike has entered the building. Doors in the office automatically slam open~
Ditch Freddy’s and actually have a gud afterlife-
I’ll drink to that~ wait I can’t drink~ Foxy is making sad noises now.
I have an idea- what if we just sit in a doorway until it collapses and destroys us!
“Won’t work! Doors have safety systems which keep them from closing on people!”
Fuck-
It’s a good thing, most of the time. Sad horny fox noises.
Well standing in the rain wont work. Charlie’s animatronic did that- and- well- Charlie possessed it- AnD iT cOnTiNuEd tO fUnCtIoN-
True. Fire?
That could work. But how do we start a fire?
Die In a Fire conveniently playing in the background.
I have no idea. Maybe we can sacrifice Golden Freddy to the gods and turn him into a flame?
That sounds like a good idea. I know Henry is an arsonist. And kinda a god. wE cOuLd SaCrIfIcE GoLdEn tO hEnRy-
ABSOLUTELY NOT. I WILL NOT BE SACRIFICED. Angry voice in the sky~
See? Even Golden is agreeing to sacrifice himself! Lets do it!
Screeching Golden Freddy noises
Chica preparing to summon and sacrifice.
Hey Mike! I need to use the cameras.
Little robot thing drives itself over to Chica, extends a camera pad up out of its head, and says ‘HERE YOU GO, SIR!’
… 1- how- 2- how- 3- SIR?!
“Sir, I detect a hint of anger in your voice. May I do anything else?”
… its fine-
Chica starts spam tapping certain cameras.
GOLDEN GET OVER HERE-
Golden Freddy is pissed-
Every time Chica taps a camera, the little bot says, ‘Boop’ but since she’s tapping so fast, it sounds like ‘BooBooBooBooBooBooBooBooBooBooBooBooBoopleasestopBooBooBooBooBoohelpmeplease-’
*continues booping*
Foxy is staring down at the little robot with confusion.
Golden Freddy has appeared, and is also staring at the bot, but with disgust.
FOXY! HOLD GOLDEN!
What.
HOLD GOLDEN! I'M GONNA SUMMON HENRY!
Absolutely not. Golden Freddy is calm panic.
Golden Freddy has been grabbed by Foxy.
Golden Feddy: *Squeak*
Chica is doing a ritual to summon Henry.
Golden Freddy’s voice has gone up 2 octaves. Let me go!
Chica is halfway through the ritual.
More screeching. I WILL FUCK YOU. Not like that. Not like that not like that nOT LIKE THAT-
Foxy is struggling greatly.
Bonnie is staring at this mess-
Which side needs more help?
hElP uS- Foxy screeches, just before Golden Freddy knees him… you know where. Foxy is now on the ground having no breath left.
Golden Freddy shrugs. That works. Turns his focus to Chica.
Bonnie runs and tackles Golden.
THAT IS ILLEEEEEEEEEEGAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL-
Foxy is wheezing at this point.
Golden Freddy grin- Mistake 1) Making contact with me. Bonnie now has virus yeeted in him.
O-o im sorry- wHaT? How tf- 
I will not explain my magic to petty mortals. Golden Freddy stands, brushes himself off, and goes back to freezing the chicken.
Chica has finished the ritual.
Fuck. Poof.
Henry is now a thing- congrats Chica- this is 100% NOT what is supposed to happen-
Logic died awhile ago.
Mike is busy working on a flamethrower, which is refusing to work.
Henry is looking around like this is a different universe.
Foxy has recovered and is standing again. Hello.
“Um- hi- why-”
We need you to set us on fire, please.
“I- that’s an unusual request- but- I got teleported here- so there is that-”
Why hello Henry-
“... Hi Chica?”
IT ACTUALLY WORKED-
“What are you doing???” Surprised Michael.
Um- summoning our creator? 
Much breathing problems.
Foxy is watching Mike have a panic attack.
Wait dont panik- we’re probably making your life much easier! We just need to sacrifice the animatronics! wHiCh wE aRe-
Golden Freddy is a pissed off ghost bean.
“W- okay then.:”
The Phone Guy’s spirit takes Henry by the hand. “Im sorry. Your summoning session has ended. Mr. Emily must go now.” Then he yeets Henry back to wherever the fuck he came from-
I- well shit-
Foxy is surprise.
Mike is struggling to english well. “Wha-”
… should I try again? 
“No. I dont want to have to yeet people more- just- get on with your fuckin night-”
“Is phone guy talking to us? Because he’s supposed to be D E A D.”
“I  A M  dead- those robotic fuckers-”
OI- WE’RE RIGHT HERE-
HEy- Robot protest noises.
Mike faceplants into the wall. “This isn’t how this is supposed to be happening- I’m supposed to be running for my life around in the office while slamming doors in your face- not that I’m complaining-”
We are the best, I know-
Happy Mike sounds.
Pissed off universe sounds.
*Images of Flyker telling the universe, ‘Would you rather I have killed you instead of Fate?’*
UwU
Okay can we start the night noises coming from Foxy.
We already did noises coming from Chica.
We really didn’t though.
Just because we arent killing Mike doesnt mean the night hasnt started.
True enough.
“Yes’nt. Wait what. ELIZABETH OUT OF MY HEAD.”
… Elizabeth? Who dat?
It’s- never mind, the wall needs to get fixed again-
*Flyker has done shit, turns time back*
Elizabeth’s his sister.
oH- that- alright- How old is your sister?
“13.”
Kewl. I  w a n t  t o  m e e t-
The wall can’t handle that, Chica.
“I don’t think-”
I. W a n t.  T o.  M e e t.
“The wall can’t handle that, Chica.”
Mike just being silent-
Fuck the wall. Well- dont- but- let the wall break- I want  to meet Mike’s sister-
Is that a good idea?
Freddy has awoken. Is busy playing Beat Saber again.
Its a  G R E A T  idea- 
NO. THE WALL.
Freddy smacks himself in the face on accident. Fackiondffoiadfnoasadfnaosidf noBLOCKSDIETODAY
I want to meet her. Besides- im 90% sure William is getting suicidal- we need SOMETHING- a little motivation- So that Cassidy kills him- and not he kills him-
“Okay fine. Where is she.”
hOw dO I kNoW?
No idea.
Mike, can you bring your sister tomorrow? I wanna meet her!
“Sure.” Fire in office. Panic Mike. Mike grabs fire extinguisher, bashes the fire to death, and figures out wtf happened/
Chica watches-
Bonnie is still napping
Foxy is help. Fire is gone.
Wtf happened-
Mike points at the processor, which caught fire when the fans stopped working for too long.
oH-
“It was shit anyways.”
Alright then-
Mike is now rebuilding shit. Better than last time.
Have fun with that- WHO WANTS TO VISIT THE PSYCHOPATH?
Which psychopa- oh that psychopath. Yeah sure.
Anyone else? Im avoiding a small party-
Mike agrees to go, as does Freddy. If it isn’t obvious, Mike is mad at le tecc.
gReAt- much smaller chance of needing to handle that thing-
Okay, let’s go. WAIT WAIT Mike. Cams. We need cams. Don’t ask why.
Mike grabs a random camera that he built because yes. “This should work.”
Okay let’s go.
Im gonna ask. Why do we need cams?
STALK THE BEAN, OF COURSE!
… which bean? 
The bean in the basement.
The bean we are about to visit?
Yeah, that one. Imma glue the camera to his head!
Mike making ‘oh my fucking god’ noises in the corner.
I like that idea- 
The beans dancing over to le door-
Mike makes sure the camera is ready to go and be glued to the bean’s head. It is indeed ready. Mike is ready to be happy. Remembers to dance back, grab a second cam, and then return to le group. “Second one so we can see his face >:)”
Alrighty- rEaDy?
“Yeah.”
DOOOOOOOR- Foxy swings the basement door open after picking the lock with his hook because SOMEBODY forgot the key.
GOLDEN?! CAN YOU GET THE KEY?!
I’m not doing anything for you. Besides, the braindead fox opened the door already. And no, I won’t give it to you for locking it- wait yes I will so he can’t escape… A demonic hole burns up through the ground, red, harsh light and many a scream pouring from it. Key spits out. Hole seals.
See. We can get along.
Foxy and Mike start down the stairs. Foxy’s eyelights click on.
Should I lock the door now?
Hell yes.
Hell no.
YES.
NO.
YES.
N O.
Yes.
Yes. WAIT NO-
Im locking it-
Okay.
Thank you.
*le lock*
Foxy can unlock it when we leave- 
*swallow le key*
Foxy makes an annoyed sound before stumbling around the last corner.
“Ah, visitors to stab?” jangling noises. “And children to eat?”
Not to stab- and no- you probably dont want to eat this overgrown child-
“Eeeexcuse me?” Mike is annoyed.
William looks over at the bunny. “You haven’t fed me in ages.”
We aren’t supposed to!
Unfortunately you are still here- Im just gonna assume Golden did shit-
“Ahhh, I could say the same for you. And yes, he’s been nice, visiting every once in a while. And don’t worry about anything, you’ll get your demise.... soon enough…” Maniac cackling.
Well I should hope so- Im bored- and with Foxy trying to beat Up and Down all day- 
Mike has begun the glue-fest.
William is pointedly ignoring the glue dripping down his face. “Flash.” Honking. “DASH.” More honking.
He’s lost his mind.
Chica is snorting-
It’s entertaining- 
Yeah.
“I have *HONK* not lost my mind, thank *WHEEZE* you.”
Second camera being glued on a stick, which is glued to le forehead.
William is now annoyed.
Yes. Yes you have.
“No no, no, no, no.” *Imitating echo*
You can say no you want. It literally changes nothing.
“Cameras are installed, I just need to hook them up.” Mike is wiring the cameras together, and wiring them up to a controller and a wifi router.
Alrighty.
Bonnie is looking at William a lil confused-
Arent you glad to see your son? 
“Yes’nt.” Echo.
Mike is busy gluing the other electronics together and to William’s head. Also, he pulls batteries out of his pocket and hooks them up.
wHaT doEs “Yes’nt” even meaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan? 
Confused Chican nugget noises-
“YES’NT. YoU YESN’NT MUST.”
He’s definitely lost his mind.
wHaT dOeS iT mEaNnN- mIkE eXpLaIn-
“It means he’s lost his everloving mind.”
William nods his head.
“Don’t move your head. I’m still gluing things down.”
William has stopped moving.
Would you like to see your daughter?
“What?” William is paying attention now.
Bonnie repeats.
Would you like to see your daughter? 
“YES.” Screech of the William.
Mike has complete.
Well, you can thank Mike. He said he will bring her here tomorrow. 
William looks up at Mike. “ThA*HOUNK*nK yoU *HOUNQ*.
Confused Mike noises.
For his sake, im gonna say he said thank you.
“That’s what I said.” William is very much insane~
Mike has plugged le cameras in and is currently testing them.
When was the last time we did a weapon check?
When Bonnie is afraid- which is rare, because Golden doesnt really scare him-
Um. A really long time ago?
Mike has commit scamper away. “Weapons check?”
I mean- he did kill us- its best to check that he doesn’t have anything-
“True.”
Foxy is looking at Bonnie. I did it last time. It’s your turn. And no, you can’t change my mind.
… well shit- Foxy- just be ready to stop him- 
Concerned fox noises.
Maniac murderer noises.
Scared bunny noises- 
Slowly approaching the crazy murder grape.
Murder grape is now holding a stick meanacingly-
More scared bunny noises-
Mike being happy that the cameras work noises, then, let’s get the fuck outta here noises.
Murder grape stabby noises.
Golden, can I attack him?
Absolutely not. He needs to be prim and proper for the future, or we won’t get killed - again - and set free.
Then can you take the stick?! 
Stick glows golden, melts to nothing.
Good?
Good- thank you-
Proceeds to check for other thingz-
The Fox is busy picking the lock on the door.
Mike is helping.
Finds no other thingz-
Door pops open.
William making a run for it-
Fox foot to the foot-
William falling back down the stairs- much p a i n.
… wow- yeah lets go-
Le fox waits for everyone to leave, then slams the door shut and locks it.
Lets never do that again.
Well we already agreed to have him meet his daughter again- so- 
God damnit.
Mike being a sad depressed meep. Then realizes he gets to talk to his sis again.
Happy Mike.
Chica is now staring at the clock.
2:00- alright then- what chaos can I create now?
Oh no.
Dont act like you’re suprised-
I’m not.
Any recommendations?
NUKE.
Y E S.
Oh fuck
Carl. Are you ready?
WHo?
C A R L  T H E  C U P K E K
Oh right.
You will be the first one to feel the wrath of CARL. THE. CUPKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Mike is in the office with the doors very much tightly shut.
C o w a r d-
Camera makes a staticy noise before his voice - all crackly and wheezy (crappy camera speakers, yay) - came through. “I heard that.”
I know you did. O p e n  u p!
Little door on the camera - which most certainly did not exist before Mike got here - pops open, little tazer named Tazy slides out, zaps Chica, then goes back into the camera.
OW! Tf iS tHaT sHoCkY tHiNg?!
“That’s Tazy.”
Triggered Chican nugget noises-
Wheezing Bunny noises
Staring Chican nugget noises-
Fearful Bunny noises-
Malfunctioning electronics noises.
Right door slides open.
“GooD thINg You’RE oN the lEft sIDe, Huh?”
Chica is already running to the right.
Mike disconnects the smart shit from the door panel and clicks the teeny-tiny lever inside from ‘normal’ to ‘lock’, causing the door to snap up closed before anyone gets in, then locks completely. No more opening, even without power. Another one of his upgrades :).
Chica is now standing outside the door like the triggered Chican nugget she is.
Mike is fear. “Good thing that door can’t open now. Oh I should probably lock the other door too.” Other door falls open with a crack and a bit of smoke from the motor. “Uhoh.”
Que Mike sliding the door up by hand- conveniently, he has little handles on the door for this very reason.
Bonnie climbs in.
Mike is fine with the bunny being here- slides door all the way up, holds it there with one hand (ow ow ow ow ow THESE THINGS ARE HEAVY), disconnects the smart wires from the door panel, then flipped the little lever to lock.
Bonnie looks around, then looks for the cameras.
Hopefully the cameras didnt fall off when he fell down the stairs-
Mike toggles a switch on a control panel, computer screen flips from the building cams to two side-by-side ones - WilliamA_Facecam and WilliamB_ViewCam (A is facing his face, B is seeing what he’s seeing.)
“They still work.”
Thats gud-
O P E N  U P!
“I’d rather not.” Lights flickering. “Oh fuck the power’s gonna go out.”
You shouldnt be worried. Chica wont  a c t u a l l y  hurt you. She’ll just yeet her cupcake. Just be happy it isn’t actually a nuke.
“Okay.” *Lights go out.* Doors conveniently stay closed because of the locks.
Fuck the power’s out. 
*casually drops le cupkek*
Imma go see if I can fix that-
Chica is now hunting around for some way to turn the lights back on.
“Okay.”
Freddy? How to turn the lights back on?
It’s in P&S, flip all the switches from ‘On’ to ‘Pilot Light’ then go to the basement panel at the top of the basement stairs and press the ‘PILOT_LiGHT’ button.
Thanks!
Proceeds to do the shit above-
Lights crackle back on,
That is- the first time i’ve ever done that-
I’ve never done it myself.
Mike is happy.
Chica is going to take a nap. 
Mike is fixing the doors. Which means that they’re open.
Carl stares at Mike.
Mike waves to Carl and gives the cupcake a lighter-
C h i c a !  A  l i g h t e r! :D
Mike has fixed 1 / 2 doors. The fixed door automatically slides up, then down. Click.
Chica and Carl are admiring the lighter. 
Foxy. We dont need Henry anymore. The lighter.
LIghTeR. Foxy appears.
Mike has fixed the other door.
Mike! You wont mind if I burn this place down, do you? You can get out now? 
Mike is staring at the animatronic. “I’d be fine with that, but, can I burn this place down?”
Sure. Golden? Ya gud with this? A certain someone would die as well.
Mike grabs the lighter and is now making a fire-basting contraption. AKA a firebomb.
Yes. I’m fine with it. No, he won’t die.
A couple of minutes later, bomb is hooked up to a power supply and Mike is saying goodbye to le animatronics who he’ll n e v e r see again-
Oh first let me do a ritual downstairs. I do intend on keeping one promise- Foxy- unlock the basement for meh-
Basement door slides open after Foxy picks the lock.
You wont mind standing guard, would you?
Foxy is standing guard.
Mike is insane and is  increasing the power of the bomb. More lighters, more C-4, more power. Don’t ask where he got the C-4.
Hi crazy person. We decided we are burning this place down!
“You’re gonna blow up the entire place- me included. oh fun. I guess I never get to see Elizabeth again-”
Y e p. So I decided you get to see your daughter today-
“Oh.”
Any other summoning requests? I might have time, if Mike doesn’t blow this place up early-
“Just Elizabeth is fine. Wait wait I wanna see CC too.” All is well in the Afton family~
Alrighty. Gimme a stick.
Stick in hand. Stick in claw. “thEre yA gO.”
A l r i g h t y. Any more sticks? 
Fourty sticks pour out of the walls.
… Im not gonna question that- 
Chica lines the sticks in a pattern.
Happy WIlliam sounds.
Chanting Susie sounds.
Faint children noises
Susie chants louder.
OEIuioeajfoijeaoppqjfoieajwesiojf epo(pretend this makes senseish) ieojfpoiaewjfoipawej poifjpawiesjpiewjspiojeapfe
Children appear, they were running in opposite directions, and they crash into each other.
Golden Freddy non-existence noises.
“WheEEEE- wait where are we…?” confused Elizabeth noises-
“... A place. With- oh hi.” Not at all concerned CC noises.
Susie casually yeets Mike in here as well.
Mike faceplants into the wall. “HEY- oh hi sis-”
Happy Elizabeth noises- *Hug*
Mike pats the head-
William is attempting to steal the child-
CC wants a hug too- other spirit of Golden has been hogging Golden.
William is commit hug the child- CC- that is-
Elizabeth breaks away and hugs le footh-
Susie starts to sing Afton Family.
Mike is also singing- like 2 octaves lower-
CC yeets Mike into a group huggeth
Everyone is hug- Mike is no longer sing-
Foxy is watching the chaos from the cameras on William’s head-
Wholesome moment intensifies-
Freddy appears at the top of the stairs. “Hate to break up the family reunion, but it’s 5AM.”
“That’s too bad.”
Should we hold off burning this place until tomorrow?
“You’re burning it?!”
Mike makes a ‘oh fuck’ face. “Uh. It’s set to go off in 20 minutes…”
“I thought he was supposed to-”
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
“But then how-”
SHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
“Should we just do it now?”
Ask Cassidy-
“SHOULD WE DO IT NOW?!” CC is now casually yelling at Cassidy.
“I’ve got the bomb rigged so I can remotely trigger it. So yes.”
Thats not what we are talking about. We have had something in the works since we kidnapped him UwU.
“Oh. You’re talking about springlocking him, aren’t you-”
Im sorry, but how did you know?
Mike just grins.
Are you from the  f u t u r e?
Mike shakes his head. “NOpE.”
Susie does not believe Mike. 
Well, yes, that is exactly what we are talking about- CASS! NOW OR NEVER!
William is attempting to escape.
Mike just grins. “Don’t touch him.”  Presses button.
My peeps let go-
CASS MAKE YOUR DECISIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-
William is now being electrocuted, just enough to keep him from running-
“Yes-”
Susie is now gonna pull a yes.
FINALLY- THE PRESENT I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SINCE THE DAY I DIED!
“O-o. Oh yeah- Dad promised to give you shit- I forgot you said that-”
Mike turns off the zapper in the cams-
Insert Springlocking later- once again, I’ll write this later-
Mike is happy- makes Chica yeet the children away-
CC is happeh as he is yeeted away- but he gets yeeted to SL for no good reason UvU. In CB’s roomish thing. 
Elizabeth is hugging CC as she’s yeeted away- and appears elsewhere- in SL- with Baby. Elizabeth knows this is the end- again-
CC is just now casually existing in SL because I yoinked him from GF and GF burned- and the family must burn together  a g a i n- fuck the canon shit- we ended FNaF 1 on night 2- and FNaF 1 burned-
Mike is by his car- just looking at the pizzeria- waves goodbye, presses the button labelled ‘NUKE’. The sign for the building is blasted past him and crushes the McDonalds across the street- 2 birds with 1 stone. Kewl.
Chica and Bonnie are standing just inside, but waving bacc- and blows up. Susie and Jeremy are now staring at McDonalds, and laughing their heads off.
The entire building explodes in flame.
Poor little souls… Mike thinks to himself as he gets in his car and drives away.
A fitting end.
Phone Guy: I guess you forgo- OHSHI- *casually blows up*
FNaF 3
Temporary character exchange: Beep ha all of the phantoms except PF Springbitch, so this isn’t all just me :)
Springtrap being in the back room all annoyed- g u a r d,  f i n d    m e   a l r e a d y
W H Y  H E L L O! W E L C O M E  T O  N I G H T  T W O  S P R I N G B E A N ! Chica is already doing something stupid-
Springtrap is happy, walking through the halls of the building, listening for shit-
Mike is wondering if he can build a door from scratch- he’s already working on that- and one for the vent too-
Springbitch is making his way around that fucking maze.
Door motor isn’t working. Annoyed Mike. Wait the powersource isn’t plugged in-
Springbitch is looking through the window.
Mike is aware- he doesn’t care- door slams shut- manually- then he manually holds it closed-
… i dont think- you’re just- making this more difficult for yourself-
“I don’t trust you. I have no idea what drugs you’ve been snorting while i’ve been gone.”
I HAVE SNORTED NOTHING- I’ve had access to nothing.
Points to bag of meth on Springtrap’s shoulder-
… THAT DOESNT COUNT-
Mike is holding door shut, continuing to work on the locking mechanism, which just keeps trying to stab him you know where-
I will just pull the door open then
Tries pulling the door upward.
“It doesn’t open that way.”
Yoinks the opposite way-
“Nor that way.”
Yoinks towards himself.
“Nor that way.”
Yeets self at door.
“Nor that way.”
HOW-
“Why would I tell you that.”
Because I am your father- and you do as I say? Casually grasping at straws-
“You’re also a murderous animatronic.” Motor finally kicks in and is now holding the door closed, since the lock is still broken.
… that- is true. But- y o u  h e l p e d  m a k e  m e  t h i s  w a y-
“Which is exactly why I don’t trust you.” Mike programming a simple logic controller for the IF DOOR CLOSED, LOCK. IF DOOR OPEN OR NEED OPEN, UNLOCK part of the system. AKA, if the door is closed, lock the door. If the door needs to be opened or is open, unlock. Simple, really.
Sometimes I question why I exist- 
“To kill helpless kids and set in motion a catastrophy of events which ends up killing your own kid- wait I’m not supposed to know about CC dying yet-”
If you let me finish- and I didn’t kill mah kids- you killed, and Circus Baby killed. I killed. Im 90% sure CC killed someone by now.
“All is hell in the afton family~” Mike, no.
If hell is where I must go to get out of this stinky ass animatronic- will do- it smells awful.
“You do end up going to hell, when the FNaF 6 pizzeria burns down-”
THE POOR WALL!
“The wall’s been dead for a while now.” Motor in the door clicks off. Mike quickly moves to hold it closed manually.
Anyways- I meant why I exist  i n  t h e  s u i t- one of those children did shit-
“You exist in the suit because CC…? stuffed you in it-”
Eh. Cassidy told him to do it.
“True.” like an idiot Mike mumbles to himself, ‘this damn door keeps trying to slide back into the wall-’
… thanks.
Starts yoinking towards the wall.
“FUCK-” rapid motor repair noises as the door beigins to slide open-
Door is opening noises.
Motor kicks in and slams the door shut. Motor straining against the bean. Mike rapidly trying to get the damned lock to work-
Springbitch is suspiciously quiet.
Mike realizes that the vent is totally open… turns around.
Vent noises. 
Mike scampers over, grabs the base for the vent door he was planning, and manually shoves it against said vent.
Stop being smart. … this is what I get for dragging you into my projects.
Mike is just working on the rest of the vent door, building it up as he’s holding it tightly against the vent hole.
Vent noises.
Door is mostly complete, electronics excluded.
Door is being pulled open. 
Mike adjusts and shoves the door back into place, beginning to work on installing the 6 motors *cause he has like 40 in the office*.
Y o i n k e t h.
Mike is face to face with le footh- fear- adrenaline- pushes door back in place- don’t look at the Chica-
Y o i n k   w i t h  m o r e  f o r c e.
Shoves it back in place and begins mounting the motors.
Y o i n k, t h e n  s t i c k  f o o t  i n  t h e  w a y.
Right. He had one more trick up his sleeve. ‘Cause he’s tricky that way. “ALpha.”
Zippity Zappity- le footh being zapped-
Footh smaccs into le door. 
Mike carefully moves le footh outta the way and then slams the door shut again, mounts a couple of the motors, builds up the glide-rail for the door to ride along, mounts that against the wall, clicks the door in, plugs in the motors, and turns them on. The newly built door over the vent slams fully shut.
CHICA HELP ME- 
I- alright-
Chica is now on the other end of the door. 
Mike crawls over to the computer and plugs it back in, waiting for it to boot up. While it’s doing that, he’s installing the extra motors on the vent door, then on the main door. Even without locking them, the doors should be able to hold up to an attack from Springboi. For a while, anyways. Once the motors started burning out, he’d have to replace them. Since he’d be running them near-constantly, they’d be buring out a little more often than he’d like.
Springy is still trying to get in. 
Chica doesnt know what she’s doing.
Poopet has joined the battle.
Poopet sits in front of Mike- blocking le view.
Mike trying to push the Puppet away while trying to block out the annoying noises accompanied by le annoying bitch- while also trying to fix one motor that already burned out on the actual door-
Springy has a foot in again.
Mike *gently* shoves Puppet off of him *don’t think about that* and is attempting to get le footh’s foot out of the door- which is annoyingly slowly pulling back into the wall, which is b i g  p r o b l e m!
L e t  m e  i n n n n n n n n n n.
“Only if you promise not to kill me.” Motor is replaced, just need to hook this last wire in...
… I cant promise anything.
“Which is why I’m not letting you in. Also, THE WINDOw IS LITERALLY GlASS, LOGIC-” Realizes mistake- runs over to window and shoves the big ass door he was planning on mounting over it onto it-
… thank you.
Yeets self at window. 
Bounces off the door which Mike has decided to not make motorized, and is just mounting it very very very very well with braces going everywhere- lots and lots of screws-
Bounces into a vent, but Mike cant see that cause he has a door in front of his face-
V e n t  n o i s e s.
Mike confirms that the door to the vent is securely locked. It is-
Somebitch do something- 
Like what? 
S o m e t h i n g-
Phantom Foxy appears, fries most of the motors on the vent door, and then poofs.
Mike is panic as he rushes over to replace them- is now being forced to hold the vent door closed, but he’s getting tired-
This helps.
Just pushing against the door.
Mike is getting really tired- finally gets the motors replaced, engages them, gives up and gets to work building the locks-
Phantom Chica screams in his face. 
Phantom Chica is also yeeted into the void for the moment- another one of Mike’s inventions. Remembers that cameras are a thing- and completely ignores them-
Phantom Foxy is getting annoyed at this point-
You cant keep good track of meh- with all the sounds.
Mike simply points to the CamTroller on the desk, which does exactly that, keeps track of where Springboi is- and ensures the camera is always locked on him.
… G e t  r i d  o f  i t. 
“iT’S uSeFul. Oh fuck-” Mike turns on the ANTI-HALLUCINATION thing- which barely works-
Chica is back and pissed.
Phantom Foxy is a nice bean and EMPs allllllllllllll of Mike’s stuff. Lights flicker out (emergency red ones crackle on a second later), the motors click off, the lock on the vent clicks and unlocks, the cameras go dead. Mike is utter panic. Luckly, he has batteries for just this reason- turns them on. Nothing happens because EVERYTHING GOT EMPd YA IDIOT-
It seems Foxy is the only smart one. 
R u d e-
But accurate-
Thank you! Happy ghost fox noises.
Mike sorta just- holds the vent door closed-
Robot Corpse is pushing against the vent door.
Mike is losing his grip on le door. Panic.
Chica screams at him again.
Mike looks over at the clock, which is just dark. Panic as the vent door slams open-
Mike’s internal thoughts: OH FUCK OH FUCK OH WAIT I STILL HAVE THE ZAPPERS- zapping insues- the damned batteries are dying tho-
Poopet blocks his view
Chica screams
Springy is angry-
The lights flicker back on- happy Mike-
Alarms-
Panic Mike-
Springbitch is now singing Die in a Fire.
The vent door beeps as power comes on- door slams shut.
Mike’s thoughts: Too fucking late, ya asshole- wait open up again please- vent door opens- Mike is now crawling through the vents as fast as he can-
Poopet stares him in the eye.
Mike bites the Poopet’s nose-
Springy grabs Mike’s ankle.
The little puncher dude in Mike’s shoe pops out and is now repetedly punching Springbitch in the face-
Springbitch winces at the first punch, but then grabs the shoe and yeets it away. 
Other shoe is rapidly punching Springy now.
Other shoe is ripped off.
Socks are now punching Springy,
Socks are ripped off.
Mike kicks Springy- then realizes his mistake- noT THE FOOT-
Springy bites his foot.
Pain, without love, pain, leAvE mE alONe I caAN’T jUST RemIX thIS rIGht nOW. Mike is pain. Mike kinda just gives up at this point-
Susie’s spirit just watching this- knowing that 5 minutes is too long. “Nuh-uh. I will not stand for this.”
“Well, you have no control.”
Mike is just wondering how he’s gonna get outta this- then he remembers-
“Hey Google, set the time to 6:00 AM.” Wishing this works-
“Okay, setting the time on your phone to 6:00 AM. You can reset it to your timezone by saying ‘Hey Google, set my time to my timezone.’”
Chimes sounding throughout the building be like wtf-
Susie: *clapclapclapclapclapclap*
Jeremy: … “that- works-”
Mike being smart bean- frees himself from Springboi and crawls to freedom-
Springyboi just staring at him-
“Sorreh Dad.” Mike scampers out of the vent
Offended Springbitch noises.
Mike calls back through the vent, “Sorry!” because he may hate the bitch, but he didn’t want to offend him.
Springehboi looks at le phantoms.
Everyone but Foxy needs to learn how to do the things- cause most of you failed- miserably- 
Foxy is vibing- to, you guessed it, Up and Down- then Addict (Caleb Hyles, Tre Watson).
*NExt night*
Mike is smort bean and gets here early so he can finish building his shit- and installing his extra cameras-
If only that worked out well- Springbitch doesnt rely on time- welcome to early night-
Alarms in office screeching that Springbitch is active- Annoyed Mike. Great, now I need to deal with an extra hour of this shit. Sprinting back to the office while the auto-systems blast Balloon Boy noises around the fucking place. Nice to know those work-
Springbitch is confused! 
Springbitch runs into a wall in confusion!
Good bitch. Runs into office, turns on the portable generator, and closes the doors. 
Foxy just watching Springtrap struggle while silently vibing to Linkin Park.
Phantom Mangle has joined the battle.
Mike getting dangerous ideas- Mike is now working on figuring out how to get wifi out here in the middle of nowhere. Remembers that he did shit the day before last that gives him wifi- connects to wifi- Is opening Spotify and hooking his phone up to the building’s audio system- and yes he has premium-
Proud Jeremy noises-
Opening Bonnie’s playlist--
Afraid Jeremy noises-
Realizes this is a bad idea and instead opens his own playlist. Of course the first song he plays is Discord.
Speakers in the building crackle on and begin blasting Discord at full volume-
Phantoms be vibing-
Susie and Jeremy be vibing-
Springtrap is sitting in a corner questioning why he is here-
Because you’re my bitch now- not like that- Turns up the volume more-
People outside the building: “Wat tah fak is goin on in daer?”
ONE OF YOU GET IT TO SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP-
But- it- v i b e-
YOU HAVE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME-
The portable generator sputters out- Mike’s phone is dead now because the battery happened to be at 1%- Speakers go silent- the echos of the music are haunting the halls for a couple of seconds- all is utterly quiet-
Thank goodness-
nUuUuUUuUuUuuuUu-
Mike is trying to figure out why the portable generator died. Figures out that one fuse blew out and he needs to replace it.
Springbitch is on the moof-
Mike is panic because he knows how fucked he is- and it just so happens that the fuse he needs is out in his Uhaul- so-
Spring is just around the corner-
Mike is aware of this fact because he hasn’t shut down the camera-trackers yet- he should probably do that because those suck up a lot of power- oh and he should probably shut down everything else he doesn’t need- Walks over to the panel, flips everything off- lights go dead- backups crackle on-
And yes he turned off O2- but he has 02 tanks for this very reason- he silences the damned alarm-
Spring is knocking at the door- and yoinking it-
Mike runs over and helps the motors to push the door closed- WHY DOESN’T THIS LOCK WORK- Mike decides he needs to fix that. “So we’re back to doing this, then?”
Its good practice? 
“Good practice for what?”
The place you will be yeeted next.
“Which is...?” Mike realizes he’s slowly sliding across the ground. Adjusts and pushes against the door harder.
Well, im demanding you go locate your sister!
“That’s easy. Sister Location, inside Baby. Oh shit the wall.” Mike is beginning to slide backwards more. More adjustment while le writer is having a conversation with Passion in the other doc-
Forget the wall. We’ve broken it so much it doesnt even exist.
“True, true.” loses grip of the door- is slammed into one wall- ass-slide- motors kick in a couple of seconds later. Door is partially open. Motors are stressed.
Springbitch has no originality- he sticks his foot in the door-
Mike scampers to the vent, forces it open, climbs inside, and slams it shut behind him. Absolutely no flaws with this plan.
You seem to have forgotten the greenbeans. 
Mike remembers the greanbeans and climbs back into the office. Runs back over to the door and is trying to shut it. Is also trying to shove the foot out of the way.
Springtrap is trying to force his way into the door. He shoves half his body in the door.
Mike is screwed. Mike attempt to close door. Fails. “So, if you promise not to kill or hurt me I’ll let you in and we can have a nice conversation?” Hopeful Mike.
Im getting in either way.
“Uh, can you promise to not kill or hurt me anyways?”
I already said I cant do that.
“It was worth a shot.” Mike is kinda giving up at this point.
Meh.
Mike realizes how stupid he’s been. Rushes over to the control panel, forces shit to turn on. All while the door is very slowly opening. Audio systems come online. BB is now being a bitch to Springtrap. Yay for auto-controlled systems. Let’s hope he doesn’t run outta power.
… A child.
Mike is just watching.
Springtrap slides back out of the door and runs to find the “child”
Door silently shuts. Mike goes back to fixing shit. He realizes that as long as Springboi is distracted, he can go get shit. Silently slips out of the building and locks the door behind him. Grabs shit. Returns. Locks the door. Enters office. Closes office door. Fixes generator. Building powers back on.
Springbitch was not amused when he didn’t find the child. 
Audio systems continue blooping him.
Springbitch is getting annoyed with the failure to find children.
Mike honestly doesn’t give a shit. Continues fixing shit.
Phantom Mangle does not like this. Mangle sits where Foxy should sit.
Mike flips off Mangle. “Go away, please.”
Foxy is not amused.
eXcUsE mE? yOu FlIp mE oFf- AnD aSk mE tO leAvE. nEvErErrRrrRr
Mangle screams in Mike’s face. Audio says no.
Mike pushes Mange outta the way, fixes audio.
Mangle calls for backup.
Poopet and Watermelon have joined the battle.
Mike doesn’t give two shits. He’s b u sy you assholes. Oh good it finally clicked to 12:00 ;-;. This is gonna be a looooooooooooooooooooooong night.
Mangle is requesting Foxy’s halp.
Foxy commit EMP.
Mike is severe annoyance as everything goes black- this time not even the backups come online. Great. I can’t see.
Springbitch is at the door.
Backup lights flicker on. Mike is holding door closed. Again. Click the damn lock into the lock- there door should be locked now.
Y o i n k
Lock bends. Mike realizes that he didn’t use the right metal for this.
Y o i n k
Lock is almost broken.
Mike is panic.
Y o i n k
Lock shatters.
Y o i n k
Door is wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide open.
Fuck.
VENT VENT VENT VENT- is in vent now. Is crawling away-
Poopet slams into him- 
Poopet is now on fire- and is shoved away. FUCK OFF YA ASSHOLES.
BB has joined the battle.
BB sits in front of Mike.
Balloon Boy is on fire and has been kicked you know where- he gets shoved into a side vent. Mike will not be stopped.
Springbitch has caught up, and Chica is putting out the fires-
“Surprise motherfucker!” Bomb in office go boom- again, firebomb. Mike vanishes- somehow- he’s magic-
Oh fuck you. When did you have timeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
When you were busy chasing children, which, btw, never existed. Disembodied Mike voice. I need him for later, mkay???
… fair enough- MAKE SURE YOU GET YA SISTER- 
I know. Hey, see ya in FNaF 6, kay?
Alrighty then- cya wall!
Mike’s voice is gone.
Wait.
He returns a second before le bomb burns the children and takes them with him- I’m not gonna burn you a second time, kay?
Susie and Jeremy are just vibing.
“You werent gonna- we just vibe in the flames-”
Oh. Returns them-
They continue to vibe.
Okay fuck FNaF 3-
FNaF 4 - nOOtmaREs-
Foxy just sitting in the back of the house waiting for night two to roll around, since it’s night one- Freddy just prepping his childs.
Dont mind nootmare chican nugget and bunny- they just vibing in the kitchen. Making a nightmare cupcake.
Foxy joins them- is helping since he has nothing to do.
Freddy yeets one of his children on the bed-
“Fuk ya child-” Flashes the Freddy child.
Freddy child screeches as it melts away.
Freddy is rather pissed. YEET YEET YEET YEET. Continuous stream of nightmare Freddles.
They scream as they melt one by one-
“Ya know what? Big brain time.”
Leave the light on the bed.
The Freddles are scared.
Foxy silently tells the others that they should go give the child a heart attack since they aren’t holding their light.
Lemme finish making my cupcake. I still need to add the teeth.
The child grabbed a long ass scarf. He ties it to the door handle. Repeats with other door.
Scarf catches fire.
“This isnt the Halloween edition, is it?”
Let’s say it is, CC. Creepy fox noises.
‘Grumble. Guess this ends night one. The room is burning already.”
Fire has spread to the bed.
Fox gets fire extinguisher and yeets it at the child. Take.
“Thats helpful. Though it would have been better if you hadn’t fucking burned my scarf. At least it will still be there when I wake up.” Casually putting out the fire.
Foxy is in the closet because fuck the nights.
“Thank you for joining my collection.”
CC forces him into le plush.
Annoyed plush fox noises.
“Ya know? I wondered why you must STAY in the closet. Lets change that.” Casually yeets out into the hallway.
Fox plush smacks into wall. Sad fox.
Bonnie stares at the fox.
Ya gud?
CC yeeted me into a plusie and then literally yeeted me down the hallway.
… why our universe. Why did WE need this CC.
No idea.
“I heard that!”
Fuck you!
“Next time im taking you to the oven.”
You can’t even go in the kitchen!
“And you arent even supposed to be here tonight!”
Bonnie has backed up. Concern intensifies-
MIKE BURNED DOWN FNAF 3 ON NIGHT 3.
“CONGRATS TO MIKE!”
Fox is fox, annoyed, fox, fox.
Chica- I think CC is crazy.
I heard.
We’re literally the child’s near-death coma hallucinations.
Except we know things that happen YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARS into the future? 
Nobody said it had to make sense.
True- or maybe we think we are in the past- but we are actually in the future!
Please don’t go down that rabbit hole. No pun intended.
I will dismantle you.
I’m literally a plushie.
I will put you in the oven for CC.
nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo-
Yes. 
I do not feel safe. I say fuck the timeline.
FNaF 3 - again-
“WHOMST THE HECCETH-” anger Mike as he’s yeeted back into le office- “I BLEW THIS PLACE UP WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY- Why is everything intact.”
Susie: “So do it again. Burn it again.”
Mike points out the lack of explosives.
“One moment.” Susie is now robbing a store. 
“Here ya go-” 
*POOF*
“They vanished.” Pause. “I don’t think Foxy’s gonna let me out that easily-
You’re damn right I’m not gonna.
“I am literally about to pretend you dont exist. F I X  I T.” CC is mad. 
Foxy refuses. SPRINGBOI- LIVE-
Nah. I did this once. I will NOT do it again. 
“You have 10 seconds.”
Nothing happens.
CC bonks his head. Foxy=forgotten and non existent.
Mike goes back to being in Sister location, FNaF 3 no longer is a thing happening-
FNaF 4 - Fuck you Foxy-
FUCK YOU TOO- wait I don’t exist.
eXaCtlY. Nootmare.
“I am now going to do the scarf shit.” Does the scarf shit. Freddles are melting.
Freddy himself appears. N O.
CC yeets the fan at Freddy.
Freddy yeets the fan back at CC. 
NO.
CC climbs on Freddy’s back and starts bashing him with the fan.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH- Grabs CC by the neck and yeets him- (saying this brings me physical pain because CC is meh bean- he one of my childz-)
Pissed CC noises. Then he remembers how to pain- pained CC noises- and pissed CC noises- its a big mix-
Foxy wants this to s t o p but since he doesn’t exist, he can’t do shit-
Golden is just watching this unfold up above with Nightmare.
Freddy crushes the bean’s feet. No running. Sadistic, grating, static-filled laughter.
“One. Does it look like I was running? Two. Get off you overweight bear!” More smaccing with fan.
Freddy breaks the child’s arm holding the fan. In several places.
S c r e e c h
Punctured lung.
In the brain of CC: Okay. Lemme just reset this- 
Freddy grins. You don’t get out of this so easily. All of CC’s thoughts are suddenly blasted with static. We’re inside your mind.
BITCH- I honestly hate you- but I cant hate you more then your Freddles.
Que Foxy requesting existence, but since CC’s every thought is being disrupted by the Freddy, never got to CC-
Freddy breaks the legs-
Desperate CC noises. 
The bear gets stabbed by Mike- “Bad bear. LEAVE LE BEAN ALONE-” stab stab stab stab-
Yeet the annoying Mike through the wall-
Mike screeching noises- Mike’s knife is yeeted into the bear’s eye.
Returns the knife to the owner’s arm.
Mike is silently trying to figure out how to get out of the wall.
Susie and Jeremy are halping Mike get out of the wall.
Mike accepts their help and climbs outta the wall.
Freddy stabs CC with claws.
Mike is rage.
CC is pain
NB and NC are concern. NC said fuckitimoutofhere-
Mike is wondering if he can start the night himself. Might as well try! RESTArT thE niGHt- Nothing. Okay. /restart
Night blips out. Mike and CC are floating in the middle of nothingness.
“That- works-”
“I restarted the night, I didn’t shut it down. Why are-” Reality fixes itself. They land on the floor of CC’s room.
“Hey im in hell again!”
“Sorry. ‘Least you aren’t alone.”
“Its fine. Lemme reset mah shit-” Resetting the scarf shit-
Mike is wondering how CC would react to him techifying his room. “If I techify your room, would you kill me?”
“I wouldnt kill you- though some certain nootmares would- and if the night resets again- it will be gone- 
“Nah, I’d be able to build it once and keep it- it’s not a default part of the environment- and why am I trying to explain this as like a computer sim- this is your mind. I’m sorry-”
Confused CC noises-
Footstep noises-
CC slams the door. S c a r f  p o w e r-
Im sorry, hOw? Confused Bonnie noises
“SCARF POWAH!”
Mike is busy making the other door automatic. S e n  s o r  t h e r e,  w i r e  h e r e.
Freddles=melting away because light is focused on them 6/8.
The door is now automatic. S L A P  B A T T E R I E S  I N  T H E  S L O T S.
Door clicks and the very dim sensor status indicators flicker to green.
“So this is what Cass meant when she said you did stuff.”
“Yeah. I still need to hook up the lights. This is so much easier than with dad-”
“What happened?”
“He came back while I was working at that Fazbear Frights place. He kept breaking my stuff and getting in. At one point he was eating my foot too. Then I set the place on fire and l e f t. Damn I’m an arsonist-”
“PFFT- hE aTe yOuR fOoT? And we all know you are an arsonist. Something you got from Henry.”
“He tried to eat my foot. Anyways, he kept yanking on the doors that I had to build from scratch, kept burning out the motors. It was a lot more annoying.”
“PFFT- He did better than Cassidy could ever-”
“It was annoying how smart he was.”
I thought the sammmmmmmmmmmmmme- Triggered Springtrap noises-
“Wha- How are you here?”
Dont question the logic. If I hadnt dragged you into my projects- my job would have been much easier-
“No kidding.”
That was a bigger mistake than telling Elizabeth that Circus Baby was for her.
“YA THINK? Wait what- You did what?”
iT wAs A mIsTaKe- I said that so she would stop bothering meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
“YOU GOT HER SCOOPED BY BABY?”
tHaT wAs NeVeR tHe InTeNtIoN?
“YOU STILL DID IT!” Mike is rage.
For the record- she wasnt sCoOpEd by Baby- she was snorted by Baby-
“Whatever.” Door slams shut by itself.
HEY-
“I thought you were gone-”
I came back when everything was restarted. Can I pleaaaaaaaaaaaaase come in?
“G r u m b l e- and no you cannot- not doing that again- nuh-uh- no way- I even have anti-freddy spray-”
Fine. No cupcakes for you then. Foxy literally baked actual, honest-to-god cupcakes from scratch.
*twitch* “Fine. But if you are lying, im gonna see if Freddy Spray works on Foxys”
The door motor disengages and the door slides open. The fox slides in, carrying four plates of cupcakes. Sets them on the bed and sits by the closet.
“hOw dId yOu GeT tHoSe PaSt cHiCa?”
I just did.
DO I SMELL CUPCAKES?!
Oh shit CLOSE THE DOOR-
Door slams shut as it detects shit-
Happy Fox.
Mike eats a cupcake. “Howy shfit feez awe gud”
H e  h a s  c u p c a k e s?
“Yuff.” CC has stuffed his face.
Can I have some??? Freddy from the other door- which also slams shut in his face.
“... do you NOT remember stabbing me? And breaking mah everyting?”
Freddy, das a nope. Foxy pops one of the smaller ones in his face. Nommin’ noise.
Mike is consume.
CC is consume.
Mike temporarily stops existing to check how his body’s doing. Is fine. Reappears.
Chica is triggered.
Door opens. Cupcake is yeeted at Chica. Door closes.
I thought I was the one that yeeted cupcakes-
Not anymore.
… Im just gonna cease to exist. My only purpose has been taken away.
Just yeet the cupcakes.
… YEET-
Spoopy Carl has been yeeted at the door.
Door stays firmly shut.
Grumble. 
“Well sory the security systems work.”
Then disable them!
“No???”
You said you were sorry!
“Hes not disabling them Chica.”
“I trust very few animatronics.”
“With reason. Im just wondering when I’m gonna wake up.”
“Uh. About that.”
“Im literally sleeping in the Entry Way Vent-”
“No, you’re in a coma in the hospital with part of your brain missing.”
“Okay- this timeline is fucked up- that was in 1983- this isnt 1983, because Dad is Springtrap-”
“Definitely. Oh you’re totally just asleep aren’t you. I’m an idiot.”
Ya thnk?
“Logic died ages ago.”
“So you could be n a coma?”
“I mean- this is normal now- these fucking idiots- But hey- Ive been chilling in SL-
“At least you get a break from the funtimes.”
“Dont get me started on the funtimes.”
“Oh?” Mike over at the door adjusting shit.
“Funtime Freddy is probably my least favorite. Always talking about birthdays.”
“Oh.” Mike knows that feeling. “I’d imagine that gets annoying.”
“Y e e e e p.”
Foxy eats another cupcake. I’m glad I’m not gonna have to deal with that.
Mike sighs. “Lucky you.”
“I can drag him into this if you want. He is in my imagination-”
“True enough.” Mike grins. “Yes.”
Freddy screeches somewhere in le house. STAHP KILLIN MEH KIDDLES!
“Oh yeah. The flashlight is shining on them 6/8.”
I NOTICED!
Freddy is at the door.
Mike looks up at the glowing eyes. “You have annoyingly good timing.” Mike reaches for the door handle since the motors are currently unpowered cause HE WAS FIXING THEM-
Freddy simply tugs the door open wider.
Mike falls on his face. “Uh oh.”
CC ties the other end of the scarf to the foot of his bed, hoping there isnt enough  r o o m  for the fat bear.
Said fat bear can’t fit through door, but can reach le Mike- who is attempting escape-
Said bear also grabs Mike and drags him into the darkness.
“Well that’s not good.”
Foxy promptly poofs into plushy form, ready to be yeeted at the bear.
“Thats- actually smort-” *Y e e t*
Foxy turns into an animatronic midair and lands on the fat one.
Mike scrambles free of the nightmare animatronic pile and bacc to le room. Eats cupcake.
Nootmare Chica just watched. Dont ask where Nootmare Bonnie is. He has no idea.
Mike wondering where Bonnie is.
Bonnie not knowing how to answer. There is a clown mask.
Mike grabs his phone and opens animotracker.apk (also known as Find My Animatronic).
Bonnie is in the Primary Control Module-
“How the hell did you get there?” Confused Mike.
“... I may have yeeted him-”
Mike slowly turns to face CC. “May I ask why?”
“Because I was bored-”
“If you promise to not kill us I’ll bring you back, Bon.” Mike being chaotic neutral.
I mean- I actually dont have the ability to promise that- its literally up to CC.
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Mike building a Return-Your-Lost-Animatronic-To-Your-Current-Location transporter-of-your-dreams.
“Lemme make your job easier.” CC has poofed. Then comes back with the Toofy Bonnie.
Mike poofs his transporter thing. “Hiyo!”
Foxy has returned to the room.
“So the only two im really worried about are Freddy and Chica- Freddy being for obvious reasons. Oh and then there will be the big bad nootmares.”
We can hear you. Burst of static. Nightmare being Nightmare.
“Good for you? I guess?”
Offended Nightmare and NFB noises.
Cupcake getting yeeted noises.
Door slamming shut.
“CC what time is it?” Mike looks at the clock which to him just says ‘nO’ since he can’t read CC’s mind.
“4.”
“Okay.” Mike has flopped onto the ground. Mike checks his phone again, looking at where Chica is.
Triggered Chica noises coming from right outside the door.
Mike decides he’s not baking tonight.
Chica attempts pulling the door open.
The door pops halfway open before the extra motors kick in, slamming the door shut again.
Mike whispers to CC, “It’ll take three animatronics to pry that door open.”
Chica does big brain. Maybe we can hold the door open long enough for Carl-
Mike is heavy concern.
F r e d d y  I  n e e d  h a l p-
Freddy walks over. Begins to help pry le door open.
Mike wondering if the motors will do anything against this.
Foxy actually being helpful, waddles over to the door, bites on the handle, careful not to break or damage it, and is trying to hold it closed.
Mike kinda just looks at CC like ‘wtf’.
CC looks back like ‘why the fuck would I know-’
Is there enough room for Carl yet?!
Not quite. Another inch!
hEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP-
Mike runs over and is attempt help- he’s not being very helpful- but like, he should be since he can fucking hold doors closed against fucking  SpRinGtRap.
Offended Scrapbitch noises 
More Big Brain Chican Nugget noises. E A T  T H E  D O O R!
Freddy lets go of the door and grabs a Plushtrap Chaser. Plugs into light socket. Plushtrap chaser is officially active.
Foxy and Mike jump away from the door.
Mike pops out of existence for a couple of seconds, then comes back with the door from le Fazbear Frights doorway thing (it’s solid titanium, don’t ask how he got that-) and begins securing it to the wall.
Chica is pushing against the door, so that Mike cant properly do shit.
Foxy reaches through the gap and stabs Chica’s eyes with his hook. GO AWAY.
Screeching Chica noises. However, Chica remains on the door. Just pressing her face against it-
Rockstar Foxy: “NO-” *Yeets Chica*
“.. Im not even gonna question what you are-”
More screeching Chica noises.
“Figment of Mike’s mind.” Poofs.
Mike and Foxy - Nightmare Foxy - are busy building door.
FREDDY HALP ME PUSH LE DOOOOOOOOOOR- tHeY aRe GoNnA sToP pLuShTrAp!
Chica rams into the door.
Freddy crushes the Plushtrap Chaser against the door on accident.
hEYyYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy- *fizzle*
Mike has complete.
Freddy activates a fleet of Plushtrap Chasers. Titanium won’t last long against 40 of these suckers.
Simultaneous knawing noises.
“I am uncomfortable with the energy we have created in the studio today.”
Mike is just staring at the Titanium. “Should have brought bedrock too.”
K N A W  K N A W  K N A W  C R A C K  K N A W
“Wanna escape to the kitchen? Not really in the mood to be eaten by these things-”
“Sure.” Mike opens the other door, looks out, and shuts the door. “Or not.”
“Who’s there?”
N I G H T M A R E  H A S  E N T E R E D  T H E  B A T T L E
“Fuck. The fattest bear.”
Door is shaking violently.
Titanium is cracking.
CC big brain noises. “I wonder if we could get the Plushtraps to eat Nightmare-”
“WE WILL NOT EAT DAD.” All of the Plushtraps screech.
Mike looks at the wall. “Isn’t Springboi-”
“NO.”
EXCUSE ME?! DO YOU ALL NEED A  L E S S O N ? !
“WE WILL CONSUME FAKE DAD.” Seveal Plushtraps turn away and begin consuming Scraptrap.
And that is my cue to leave. Scrapbitch poofs.
The Plushtraps resume their attack of the door.
“Okay. We pick our poison. Nightmare, or the Army of Plushtraps, with Nootmare Freddy and Chica and Carl.”
“Preferrably neither.”
Agreed. Plus, they’ll probably kill me with you too, since I’ve turned.
“Does it look like we have a choice?”
“Nope!”
Big Brain. Again. “Dont the Plushtraps freeze in light?”
“UH OH.”
Mike grins. “Working on it.” Mike is now building a massive-ass floodlight.
CC takes the flashlight off the bed and points it at the door. He has the other door shut with the scarf.
Mike notices the smoke pouring out of the motors on the Nightmare door. “Oh. I ‘ll need to fix that.”
“Keep that door shut. I have flashlight power going on this door.”
Mike is almost done with the floodlight (more than 50x more powerful than the flashlight held by CC.)
Fuck. Lets help them break the door.
Mike connects the last wire and the fucking sun is in the room now. Door breaks apart and the Plushtraps begin pouring in, pointedly looking away from the light.
Chica yeets Carl at Mike. CC leaps away from the door
Foxy yeets Carl into his mouth.
Mike yeets himself in CC’s general direction, smacking into the wall next to the other child.
Chica is running to the other door.
Mike realizes that the motors on the other door won’t be able to handle a 450 pound animatronic slamming into the door. “Uh oh.”
Nightmare get out of the way!
Nightmare is smart enough to get out of the way before he gets crushed by an animatronic twice his weight.
Chica slams into the door.
The door slams open, motors literally explode in tinly little poofs of smoke.
“WELL SHIT.”
Foxy~
Foxy being dirty for a couple of minutes to save his fucking life. Wat, ya want sex or somethnin’?
… Hell no- thats illegal. 
You
You’re the one talkin’ with tildes.
Im going to forget you said that.  Y o u  a t e  m y  c u p c a k e.
Suggestive smirk.
Mike is just watching this interaction with interest-
CC regrets meeting the internet.
More suggestive smirking and movements- Foxy is internally dying at this point.
Mike wondering weather or not he should take CC and go-
“This is why I never used the internet again.”
“You’re the one that decided to Google that without SafeSearch on.”
“You’re the one that didn't explain it.”
“I shouldn’t have to! Dad should have done that, but then again, he’s a shitty dad sometimes-”
I HEARD THAT! sPoOpY vOiCe FrOm ThE sKy-
“FAKE DAD CONSUMPTION!”
I would be scared if I weren't just a voice.
Said voice is being consumed.
Said voice poofs.
Mike remembers the Plushtrap Chasers at their feet- picks up CC and runs-
Paniked CC noises.
Chica has fled the building. She couldn’t handle the chaos.
Foxy drops the act and screeches as the Plustraps begin to try to eat his legs. Locks self in closet.
Mike is standing on top of CC’s dresser- still holding CC-
“5 a m - 6 a m   h u r r y”
Mike is looking down at the Plushtraps who are looking up at them, grinning. “What time is it.”
“... I just said it- 5  a  m.”
“Oh.”
YOu aren’t escaping this time, Mike. Your luck has run out. Nightmare doing Nightmare shit-
“How fast are you, Nightmare?”
Pretty damned fast.
“Faster than Foxy?”
Close enough.
“Foxy, you thinking what i'm thinking?”
Foxy runs over, picks up Mike, who is holding CC, and runs for dear life.
Bonnie is vibing in the kitchen.
Foxy runs in and crashes into Bonnie. SORRY-
Mike is dropped by Foxy.
Mike just sorta pulls CC in closer as he tumbles to the ground- he lands on the bottom, CC on top-
yAy foR crAckEd rIBS-
What happened?
WE’RE IN DEEP SHIT!
Well, hopefully you can last 57 more minutes. 
“That’s-” Wheeze. “A really long time-” Mike struggling to breathe ‘cause A) Cracked Rib, B) CC’S STILL ON HIM-
CC realized he is sitting on a human. He leaps off said human- 
Mike thanks CC and stands up, arm to chest, breath ragged. “That hurt.”
Sorry.
I know you’re in there~ come on out! Nightmare noises.
Bonnie ish gonna try and halp. Its just me. I heard Chica lost her cupcake. Im making her a new one.
I swear I saw the others go in there. Are you sure they aren’t there?
Mike locks eyes with Bonnie.
I heard footsteps outside, but never a door creak.
Mhm. I’lm going to keep looking for them.
CC holding his breath-
Mike is also holding his breath.
Good luck. Where is Chica?
Nightmare walks away.
Bonnie proceeds to actually start making a cupcake. He signals to the beans to hide in a cabinet-
CC slips into said cabinet.
Mike joins CC. It’s very cramped.
CC grabs Foxy and Foxy is now in the cabinet.
Mike is surprisingly comfortable with  being this close to the other bean-
Bonnie closes the cabinet. Cupcake is being made. A few moments later, Chica slams the kitchen door open.
W h e r e   a r e  t h e y ?
Not here. I already did this with Nightmare. There was only two moments this door opened. For Nightmare, and when you slammed it open. 
Mike is holding his breath.
Anyways, here is your cupcake.
… thanks-
Chica has taken the cupcake and run to meet Nightmare.
Mike is waiting to see if they’re good.
WHERE ARE THEY, BONNIE? Loud Nightmare blasts the door off its hinges.
If I knew I’d tell ya, bud. 
JEREMY~
You seem to have mistaken me. Im not Jeremy. This- *aggressive pointing at Jeremy* -is Jeremy.
BONNIE I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL-
Thinking Nightmare noises.
Fuck me? No thanks.
CHOP YOUR DICK OFF-
I am an animatronic. Does it look like I have one?
More thinking Nightmare noises. If you did I wouldn’t want to know, or see, would I? Much confused Nightmare.
Lemme make this clear. I dont.
TheN hOW Am I sUppOSEd tO thREaTEn yoU- foRcE chiCa to- Nightmare stops himself-
I dont want to know how you intended on finishing that sentence.
You really don’t.
Meh. What time is it?
Nightmare looks at the cabinetcabinet. CC, would you mind telling us the time, please?
Mike is silently panicking.
Big brain CC moment. CC has now imagined a clone of himself. Because this is his mind. Le clone is standing behind Nightmare. “5:28.”
Nightmare wheezes and eats the clone.
50 clones intensifies.
Nightmare knows he’s being fucked with, and marches over to the cabinet and yanks it open. Oh hi.
“... Hi.”
Mike punches Nightmare in the eye. 
Nightmare is just standing there, like, ‘did this hoom just punch me?’. EXCUSE ME?
Punch.
I WILL EAT YOUR SOUL.
“I’m fine with you consuming mine, but don’t touch CC or you’ll die.”  Mike stares Nightmare down.
Nightmare is considering eating CC anyways.Nightmare’s mistake- not getting rid of the CC clones.
The CC clones now have weapons. Some climb on him, some slip in front of him. Either way, hes getting beat up and stabbed.
Fleet of Plustraps are consuming every CC clone.
CC clones are multiplying. Half of them are now focused on the Plushtraps. Full out war of small beans.
Nightmare is ignoring the chaos. Attempts to grab CC.
Receives kick to the face.
CC clones are stabbing Nightmare’s face. Some are trying to cut off his arms. With a chainsaw. Where the fuck did they get a chainsaw.
Nightmare vanishes.
Plushtraps have begun multiplying at a rate 7x greater than the CC clones.
The Mike clones join the fray.
“Where the hell-” Mike is staring at the clones.
CC is honestly considering yeeting himself into the chaos. Hes smart enough not to- but staying in the cabinet probably isnt the smartest idea either-
Mike wholeheartedly agrees.
Mike also notices that the stove burners got turned on at some point.
“Uh oh.”
CC is more seriously considering yeeting himself into the chaos. Just to stuff some Plushtrap Chasers onto the stove.
Plushtrap Chaser tries to eat CC’s face.
Said Chaser has been yeeted onto the stove.
“GAHSJJDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiii-” Puddle on the stove.
“Oooh! Time to make Plushtrap Pancakes!”
CC has yeeted one onto the stove.
Mike is seriously wondering when this night is gonna end. Yeet.
Foxy has become normal sized and is currently crushing Plushtraps underfoot.
Mike notes Freddy is staring at them.
The Freddles have entered the fray.
Mike is getting rather concerned.
CC shines a flashlight on the crowd. 
P O O F.
Mike feels a tiny bit better.
More yeeting of the Plushbitches.
Nightmare has returned, this time, with a lot of nightfreddles (his own twist on Freddles. They don’t die in light.)
The Nightfreddles attack.
CC clones be yeeting them all over the place. 
“I have lost count of how many clones I have- I also finally respect how big this kitchen is.”
Mike clones are pouring from the light fixtures.
“Where are these clones coming from-”
“Probably my brain.”
“Right.” Mike is looking down at the chaos. Looks up. “Oh it’s 5:59. Here, gimme a hug before I vanish for the day.” *Hugs CC*
*Hugging intensifies*
Alarm clock noises. Mike vanishes.
CC flipping off Nightmare intensifies.
NEXT NIGHT
Mike faceplants into the wall. “Ow.”
“Welcome back. Expect a very hostile Nightmare. I flipped him off.”
WHAM.
Mike looking at the Nightmare who literally shoved his face through the fucking wall.
CC’s heart jumps, but then he starts laughing- 
Mike joins him. “Y-you l-lo-o-ok redic- *SNORT* ulous-”
“You rEaLly- reEAAALy- dO-”
Nightmare silently moving his jaw up and down while still lodged in the wall.
CC loses it-
Nightmare shoves his face further through the wall.
Mike boops his nose.
Mike can no longer breathe.
CC is literally rolling on the floor-
HEADS WILL ROLL TONIGHT!
Mike joins CC.
Nightmare is literally steaming- the wall around his face is beginning to melt.
“tHiS jUsT gEtS bEtTeR aNd BeTtEr!”
Nightmare flickers out.
Mike is catching his breath.
“I fully expect to die again tonight-”
Mike commit sideways look. “‘Again’ as in you’ve died before?”
“You are the one that did it- r e m e m b e r-”
“I was dRUNK-”
“fAiR eNoUgH-”
“‘Sides, it ain’t happinin’ again.” Cool brother smile.
“Maybe you wont. nIgHtMaRe mIgHt-”
“Trust me, he won’t.”
“I hope so- Nightmare is worse than Freddy- and Freddy- is terrible.”
“Especially with the ultra-sharp teeth. Wouldn’t end well. And he probably wouldn’t stop at your head either.”
“F e e t.”
“Probably.” Mike notes that all of the the electronics are burned out. That’s gonna be annoying to fix.
“Welp.”
What are the chances that we are all going to die? AfRaId BoNnIe NoIsEs- yes hes just inside- cC lEt hIm- 
“Ask Nightmare.” Mike mumbled.
Somewhere inside the house, Nightmare responded with, Death is inescapable. 199%!
G r e a t.
No, I mean, everyone dies eventually.
“He’s turned into a philosopher.”
Last time that happened it didn’t end well Foxy shoves another cupcake in his face. Where’d he get this one? He found it in the kitchen.
... w h e r e  d i d  y o u  g e t  t h a t  c u p c a k e-
Both Foxy and Mike simultaneously said, “Kitchen” then looked at each other in surprise.
How did you know that?
Mike shrugs.
There is a chance you just ate Carl again. Unless you made cupcakes in a few minutes.
Foxy wheezes. SHE”S GONNA KILL ME- AGAIN-
This is why you dont eat random cupcakes. You only eat the ones not made by Chica. Most others are safe.
Mike wheezes in response to this.
HAS ANYONE SEEN CARL?! Frantic Mother Spoopy Chica noises.
Foxy is 101% silent. What’s the deal with the extra 1% over 100? He’s sucking 1% of the noise in the room into him.
I KNOW I HAD HIM DURING THE SMALL TIME PERIOD THAT IS DAYTIME-  W H E R E  I S  C A R L?!
“Maybe he went to get a shower?” Mike suggests, shrugging and looking to CC for help.
CUPCAKES DONT SHOWER?!
“Then I have no idea. We haven’t seen him, since, y’know, we’ve only been here for a  couple of minutes, and you haven’t yeeted him at us.
NIGHTMARE?! HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?!
The fox took him.
Gulping fox noises.
Mike grabs CC and slides under the bed with him, leaving a flashlight to where the Freddles m e l t  i n  h e l l.
Foxy feeling alone. He also knows he’s absolutely fucked.
Heavy footsteps intensify.
It was an accident! I swear! Foxy is desperate.
You should know not to eat cupcakes that are in the kitchen unless you made them. Spoopy Chica is at the door.
I THOUGHT BONNIE MADE CUPCAKES THOUGH!
Dont drag me into this- it takes me 2 hours to make normal cupcakes.
Mike silently watching from under the bed be like 👁👄👁. Foxy’s totally screwed.
Foxy melts into the shadows, hiding.
CC yeets himself at the door and slams it shut in Chica’s face.
Mike blinks and looks where CC was a moment later. “Holy fuck you’re fast.” Slides out from under the bed when the Freddles try to give him hugs.
“Something that happens when you yeet yourself at doors all the time.”
“I’ve gotten stronger. You’ve gotten faster.” Mike mumbles. 
“Fuck- my brain took that and ran-”
Mike wheezes and turns red. “NOT-”
Foxy peeks his head out from behind stuff. Faster at... what?
Mike is dying.
“sTrOnGer… wItH wHaT?”
Mike wheezes harder.
“And I’m stronger than you~” Singing fox noises.
CC is having a difficult time breathing.
Que Nightmare shoving his face through the wall again. HAI-
Foxy literally goes through the roof.
“P F F F T-”
D A N G L I N G  F O X  L E G S  T H R O U G H  T H E  C E I L I N G
Mike is on the ground rolling around- again.
Door has been abandoned. Chica can open it- but she doesn tknow if thats a good idea-
Foxy faceplants to the ground again. CHICAN NUGGOUT ALAERT.
Chica is concerned- 
Mike stands up again, kisses Nightmare on the nose, and slams the door shut.
Nightmare is doing his impression of a murderous fish. DID YOU JUST-
Bonnie, Chica, and CC are just laughing their heads off- Bonnie literally lost his head-
Mike notices this and is wheezing to death.
Mmmhmhmmfmfhmfmhfmfhfmfhmfhmfhmf! 
Mike shoves his head back on.
Thamk yoi-
“No problem.” Mike commit smile.
Chica realizes her mistake and backs out of the room.
Mike closes the door behind her.
Chica wants to fade into nothing- she is now “silently” making her way to the kitchen where she will be for a while-
Nightmare pays her a visit while she’s in the kitchen. Bad Chica...
Fear 1000
Nightmare has begun the dismantling.
Screeching Chica sounds, poofing Chica sounds.
Nightmare being like ‘w h y  m e’. FREDBEARRRR-
nO-
YES-
Fine.
Fredbear laughing noises.
“What, so we’re doing 20/20/20/20/20/20/20? Or just ‘BBBBBBBBBOOBS! Mode?”
More like… 20/20/20/1000000000000littleshits. Because now Chica seems pissed at Nightmare. And- why do people call it “BBBBBBBBBOOBS! Mode?”
“Because Markiplier is an inappropriate idiot. It’s also the night that Nightmare’s supposed to live, but since logic died… Now we get to get that difficult hardass and the other difficult hardass, and all of the animatronics.”
Um- I only just started watching him. Sad Bonnie noises.
“It seems like Chica is on our side- so- that helps-”
“Somewhat.” Mike just working on his little gun project.
I mad at both Nightmare and Foxy. I just need to decide who has a higher chance of killing me if I attack them. Nightmare would-
Carl noises emanate from Foxy’s general direction.
Chica grabs Michael’s wrench and stabs into his stomach. She doesnt hit carl- she can sense her child.
Surprised fox noises.
Y o i n k s  Carl out-  
CC respawns Foxy. 
Michael accidentally makes gun shoot.
Loud surprised bear noises from the hall.
“... thats awesome. SHOOT THE BEARRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!”
Bang bang bang bang bang bang.
A heavy body hits the ground outside the door.
“Y E E E E E E  E E E E E” Happy CC noises-
Nightmare slams the door open. YOU SHOT HIM?
Bang bang bang.
Surprised Nightmare noises.
H a p p y  C C.
Nightmare falls to the round, limp noodlz style.
*clapclapclapclapclap* Happeh CC noises.
“Now what?” Mike notices a bit of twitchiness in Nightmare. Que rapid bangs.
Nightmare continues to get back up.
Mike reaches behind him and grabs one of those fluorescent light tubes (like the ones in school), shoves it down the barrel of a different contraption, hooks it up to an outlet and pulls the trigger.
The fluorescent light tube blasts out the end, leaving a trail of burning air behind it. It slams into Nightmare and fucking explodes.
Nightmare is sent through the window.
Mike does it again for good measure.
Foxy sorta leans out the window and looks at the smoking pile of liquid that used to be Nightmare. He turned all melty. Remind me not to piss you off.
Mike turns back to le smoller brother. “Kay, now what?”
Fredbear stands.
Mike whirls around and literally blasts him with a flamethrower.
Melty bean.
Mike cautiously turns back to the child. “...okay.”
CC justadmiringthis.
Froddy looks at the puddle.
*Gun loading sounds*
Freddy looking up and realizing he’s dun fukd up.
Froddy is briefly a shadow demon before he gets sucked to hell by Luci.
Foxy kinda just stares where Froddy became a floppy banana and poofed. Holy shit-
“Im suprised that worked- but even more surprised they arent immediately coming back.”
“Luci’s probably kicking the shit outta his eyeballs.” Completely serious Mike.
“... I can just summon him back by letting the freddles do their thing-” 
“Probably, but Luci’s just gonna drag him right back to-”
“HEY-” Offended Luci screech as he’s yeeted at Mike.
Mike catches the demon.
“Oh hey. A demon has been sent to a different hell!”
Gibbering Luci as he tries to free himself to scratch the child. Uh, the CC child.
Mike calms Luci down.
CC is doing his best to not snort- 
Luci is commiting shoulder sit.
COMMUNISM! Angry Freddy screeches.
Facepalming CC noises.
Freddy appears.
Scatting Luci. Yeeting Luci.
Staring Bonnie and Chica.
Luci being chaotic evil and bouncing around the room. “What the fuck you looking at?”
… you-
Bonnieno-
Luci calms down and crashes into the bed. He’s lost in the sheets for now (he’s like a foot tall ;-;)
Mike looks at CC like, ‘idfk’.
Freddy seems to remember what he’s supposed to be doing and bites part of CC’s head off. Literally.
Mike immediately goes into Brotherly Rage.
Freddy is very fearful for his life.
CC be like: this is normal.
Mike makes time back up slightly, to before the bean was bit two seconds before. Freddy is now trapped against the wall with a very pissed off brother about to stab his soul.
Luci is kicking Freddy in the shins.
Freddy poofs.
“You alright?” Concerned brotherly noises.
Confused CC noises. “tHe fUcK jUsT haPpEneD?”
“Freddy tried to eat you again.”
Luci bouncing around the room noises.
“... What is it with Freddys and trying to eat me?”
“They’re assholes.”
Literally every Freddy in existence: “Hey…!”
“Except Gabriel-” Mike remembers the nice bear.
ThAnk yOU- Happy Gabriel noises (SINCE FREDDy’S MY BEAN THE CHILD’S MY BEAN).
Luci finally frees himself from the labyrinth of fabric. “I’m frEEEE-”
CC is preparing for his ears to bleed-
Luci has returned to being a rocket.
Is… he high on catnip? Ducking fox noise.
“I”M NOT A- *wHAM* CAT- *SLAP* BUT- *CRASH* I AM *BOING* HIGH ON CATNIP* WHIP*” High Luci noises echo through the room.
Mike pulls down CC before he gets a Luci-shaped hole through his head. “How did he get catnip???”
Foxy stands up a bit, and immediately Luci slams into his back and knocks him down.
“Idk! The more important question is HOW TO STOP HIM-”
“I HAVE NO IDEA!” Mike watching the high cat-demon bounce around may sound amusing, but t was, in fact, quite terrifying.
“I can kick him out- I can kick him out- I  c a n  k i c k  h i m  o u t”
“Uh, you’d have to kick me out to do that because he’s my personal Demon.” Embarrassed Mike.
“iTs mY bRaIn?!”
“True.”
“Imma just open the doors-” CC just casually crawling across the floor- trying to get to the fuckin door without getting smacced into-
WHAM. CC is crushed by Luci who bounces off and continues on his way.
“YEP- THATS IT-” Pissed CC noises.
Mike ducks at that. BALLISTIC CC ALERT- mental screaming.
CC yeets himself at the bed- then tries to catch Luci with the blankets-
While Luci would love to be in / on a set of bedsheets at the moment, he wouldn’t like it to be with this child nor in front of these people. Luci slips out of the sheets and rams into the wall. Luci is now unconscious.
Mike is more calm now.
CC goes to the kitchen and turns on the oven- and yeets Luci in the oven.
“Oh hey this is comfortably warm.” Happy Luci noises. He’s from hell, child. Oh right, and heat turns him on.
Uhm.
I mean.
Heat makes him wake up.
Mike is just watching this from the doorway like ‘wtf’.
Content CC noises.
Luci simply frees himself.
CC is triggered.
Luci doesn’t care.
Mike is watching this chaos unfold. “How long until the night ends?”
“Wake up Liutenant!” *Rapid loud slapping sounds* “It’s me, Connor!”
“It ends… good question. Luci broke the clock.”
“LuCIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-” Anger Mike.
Luci skitters away quite quickly. He knows better!
Mike has returned to the room and is busy fixing the fucking clock. “He completely destroyed this fucking thing…:”
“At least the clock doesnt actually determine the time.”
“Unlinke in FNaF 3-” Mike is annoyed.
You cheated though- I would have won- A N D  Y O U  C H E A T E D- Pissed Scrappy Bean.
Mike gives exactly 0 shits.
Not -10 shits? At least it’s not the negatives-
Mike has reached -100 shits.
I spoke too soon-
Indeed. Foxy is attempting to help now.
“... Okay- now Im sorta questioning whether to just say ‘fuckit’ for this night-” yes CC said this-
“I’d be perfectly fine with that.” Mike shrugs as he sets the clock on fire. “DAMN-”
What is it with you and fire?
“I’m very good at creating it.” I hope you die in a fire~
Die In A Fire is now blasting through the house-
“Did my brain just turn into the Spotify playlist???” Startled Mike.
“N e v e r!”
“Uhmn.”
“DIE IN A FIRE ISH GUD, OKAYYY?!”
“Yesh.” Mike accidentally sets the clock on fire again.
“... can you do ANYTHING without making a fire?”
“Nope.”
“... you need help. A lot of it.”
“You wanna try this?” Mike looks at the bean questioningly.
“No. Im saying you need help. You think I can do any better? ”
“I know what you mean.” Mike has extinguished the flame and has fixed the clock.
“Once this shit is done, you should get halp- before you burn more shit-”
Mike is silent.
“You planned on burning more shit, didn’t you-”
“Actually, no.”
“Good to know. I’ve already had my bedroom burned by a certain Foxy.”
Foxy is choosing to ignore that comment.
“... welp. Im bored.”
“End the night and we’ll come back and then we’ll be less bored because  a n i m a t r o n ic s.”
“Smort. NIGHTETH- ENDETH-” 
The world stops existing, Mike has disappeared. Luci goes with him.
Looks like the world has been dun yeeted.
Mike is waiting for Night 3 to start.
N i g h t  3  L i v e s
Mike exists.
Foxy, Freddy, NFB, and Nightmare have all been factory reset. They are back to being alive and murderous machines.
CC exists
Animatronics do the shit above because im too lazy- 
Foxy clicks active and screeches free from the room.
“... That was loud-”
“No kidding. What got into-” Mike notices the lack of automatic door systems. “Uh-” All his shit’s gone.
“I t ‘ s  f i n e. I have a whole system. Now, unless the abundance of scarves is gone, we should be fine.”
Mike looks at where the missing dresser should be.
“Well. Shit. Guess we gotta be somewhat normal. I dont like that. I WANT MY SCARVES-”
“I don’t like being normal. Normal never got me anywhere in life. Normal never got me far with relationships. Being normal got me shot several times in my career.”
“Well. Maybe we pull a Markiplier and swear our way through it-”
“THat only works because Mark was wearing his ‘lucky flannel.’
“Good point. I could try and find your room-”
“I don’t have a room. Nothing exists in this house except these halls, your room, and the kitchen.”
“Well. I- why- f u c k.”
“It’s your dream.”
“Well. THEN WHY ARE MY SCARVES GONE?!”
Mike points at the floating errors in the air mostly consisting of one dependancy or another being missing. One thing of note is that ‘Animo-peace.sett’ and ‘.andrd’ are missing. In addition to this, several errors, such as ‘Mike-circuit.exe’ or ‘Mike-doorintellect.lod’ are also drifting around. “Definitely not normal.”
“This makes no sense- but- neither does my nightmare in general- so-”
Mike briefly blips out of existence, then comes back. “Looks l1k3 I might b3 in a b17 0f a pi(kl3.” GlitchyMike.
“What did you do-”
“n0 id3@.” Mike is becoming increasingly staticy.
“... imma guess imma be alone-”
“o|\|(3 1 |=1X 7|-|3 P40|ol3m 1 can c0|\/|3 |o@|<.” Mike poofs into many errors mostly consisting of ‘err_connection_lost’.
“... thats no gud-”
---
Mike
Mike has returned to the real world to the lovely smell of burnt out capacitors. That’s gonna be annoying to fix. After about 20 minutes he finally replaces the last of the hundred capacitors, hooks the capacitorLink wire back up, and hops back into the sleep chamber that lets him yeet his presence into the other bean’s head.

Mike & CC
Mike has returned. “Am bacc.”
CC is currently planning.
“Welcome back.”
“Whacya plannin’?” Mike hears footiesteps and slams the door in Foxy’s face.
“When to throw Foxy at the other animatronics. Why?”
Grinning Mike. “I can pull some strings if you give me enough time.”
“deargoddontbreakmyshitagain-”
Mike has frozen, and looks like a hologram right now. He’s flickering slightly too.
“... oh great.” footsteps intensify- door slamming intensifies-
After about 43 minutes Mike has returned to living. CC’s scarves have returned and Mike is holding a Foxy cannon.
Happeh and confused CC noises.
Foxy pries a door open.
Mike sends a nuke at his face.
Foxy consumes the nuke.
Cue Mike staring in shock as the nuke explodes in Foxy’s stomach and he doesn’t blow apart.
“Foxy- just- get in the closet-”
Foxy obliges.
Mike runs over, tapes a flashlight pointing down at Foxy, and turns it on. Foxy is now stuck in plushie form.
CC already has his flashlight melting the Freddles. No Freddy tonight. UnU
Cue Foxy and Freddy having a mental screaming contest.
Cue CC shoving things in front of the doors.
Mike is helping the bean shove thingz ‘round.
Doors are blocked.
Nootmare Chica and Bonneh are pissed-
Foxy is mentally screeching at Freddy for help.
Mike is busy gluing the doors closed since :sporkle: no electronics :sporkle: even though there’s a lot of shit in front of the doors. Glue here, glue there, glue everywhere. Mike is totally not paying attention to what he’s doing.
Foxy is wondering what the fuck Mike is doing.
CC is also wondering what the fuck Mike is doing.
Mike has returned to existing and has stopped squirting glue everywhere.
Facepalming CC noises.
Mike has cleaned up the errant glue.
Foxy has given up.
Chica is attempting to commit big brain with Bonnie. Bonnie is calling her an idiot. Bonnie has been yeeted.
BonBon noises.
Mike yeets BonBon away outta sheer surprise.
“ALL MY FREINDS YEEET ME-”
Funtime Foxy yeets Bonbon back and poofs.
“. . . Yeah im never going to question that- Im now afraid of waking up-”
“Probably for the best.”
“Yeahhhhhhh.”
Cue the clock flipping to 3:AM.
Mike is staring at the clock, then CC, then the clock again. “Did it just-”
“Oh hey- the cursed hour- I am now half expecting a Breadbear-” 
Flurry of activity.
“I mean a legit, cursed, Breadbear-”
Mike quickly Googles Breadbear.
Mike remembers this thing. Mike is intense fear.
“Dont blame me! It gets boring being a dead thing.”
Mike hears bread noises from the hallway.
“And Google is both cursed and entertaining.”
Bread noises are slamming against door. Door is shaking violently.
Mike is very fear. “What are we supposed to do?”
“I dont know. Canonically I slam the door in his face. Here we have wet glue everywhere and shit covering the door.”

Pankek: *Glitch noises*
Sister Location
Mike, Oliver
---
Looking out the window in the hall, Mike realized his mistake. He’d come home late, again. Oliver’s gonna kill him. Anyways, we’ll deal with that when we come to that.
Mike silently walked over to the ‘shoe stand’ as Oliver called it, untied his shoes, and put them under said stand. He creeped into the living room, as he wasn’t sure if Oliver was asleep or not. If he was, Mike didn’t want to wake him up. Maybe he’d survive tonight after all.
Considering how he’d be at another Freddy Fazbear’s location, even a sister location, Mike didn’t think that was so likely.
He stepped into the dining room and sighed. Yeah, of course Oliver was sitting at the table. Why wouldn’t he? This was the problem with relationships, you always got in trouble with the other member.
“May I ask why you’re getting back at 9 at friggin’ night?” Oliver sounded rather tired. It made sense though, considering how Oliver had the 5:30 AM shift at the local grocery store. Why did he have to get up so early? They were struggling to make ends meet, considering how Mike kept getting fired (or he fired up the place) from all of his jobs. Oliver was having to work for most of the day, while Mike had to work most of the night. They typically really only got to talk over the phone, on Saturdays, and whenever both of them were home at the same time.
Anyways, the fact that Oliver was still up was not a good sign for Mike.
“I had a job interview today. And yeah I know it’s kinda late.”
“Which job is it for?”
“FESL.”
Oliver just stares at Mike for a couple of seconds like he’s fucking insane… which he probably is. “I thought you said you were DONE working for FazEnt?”
“I was. Until they gave me a good job opportunity at this newer facility of theirs. It’s some underground bunker-esque thing where they host birthday parties and stuff.” Mike shrugged. “And the bills are starting to stack up a bit, so… I took the opportunity. It pays well enough.”
Oliver sighs and shakes his head. “There’s another reason, isn’t there.”
Damn, he knew him too well. “Yeah. CC’s there too. And Eli.”
Oliver nods in understanding. “When do you have to be there?”
“Midnight.” Sigh.
“As to be expected. Let me guess, 6 AM?”
“No, actually, I get to come home at 4! At the latest, I mean I come home when I finish my shift.”
“So we’ll have an hour to be together in the mornings at a minimum.. Okay. I’m okay with this.” Slightly less anxious Oliver sounds.
Mike grins. “You should get to sleep soon.’
“Only if you come with me.” Grin.
Mike shrugs, then grins. “Sure, why not.”
CC, Mike, AnImAtRonICS oF fEAr (At SL)
---
“... Oh no- BonBon-” CC’s immediate reaction to waking up.
Random scurrying noises.
“W e l l  s h i t- at least im awake-”
“-It seems you had some trouble with the keypad. I see what you were trying to type and will autocorrect it for you. Welcome, Eggs Benedict.”
“wHaT? i NeVeR uSeD a KeYpAd?!”
“Ehm. Handunit, I do believe that you miss-corrected my name. It’s actually Mike.”
“W h e n  d i d  y o u  g e t  h e r e?” A very confused CC.
“About 3 minutes ago. I’m still in the elevator. ~Intercom hax~”
“How much do you intend on changing in here?”
“Not much. But I did bring more than a hand-flash-unit for night 3.”
“How do you know what is happening Night 3-”
“I have my ways. Anyway, how you doin’?” Mike refrains from thinking about F.R.I.E.N.D.S for the moment.
Silent Foxy. Hey director can you fix this?
He’s my bean you overgrown sack of potatoes.
CC has cued the music. 
Mike is heavily concerned for the bean’s safety. He’s also currently modifying his HandUnit so that HandUnit actually tells him what the fuck to do because ~snuggles await~.
“Alright anyone wanna join me? pArTy sTaRtInG iN a FeW sEcOnDs-”
Mike is seriously debating skipping the night and going back to ~semi-cold room with very warm hugs~.
CC is now looking at Mike with a stare that says “No.”
Mike shrugs. “it was worth a shot.”
CC is now yeeting himself around the vent, spinning- 
“YOUSPINMERIGHTROUNDBABYRIGHTROUND-*
Mike is staring at the child in fear.
BonBon has joined the party- The vent is being damaged-
Mike yelps a bit at the appearance of BonBon.
Minirinas have joined the party.
Anxious full-of-minirinas-Stanely-Noises. (fuck you logic and time)
CC stops spinning for a second to stare at them. Then decides it’s not worth the time to critizize them for shit- I t s  s p i n n i n g  t i m e-
Mike pulls a Jacksepticeye, cuts a hole in the vent, creeps past GLaDOS, and escapes into the non-safe area of the magical Control Module.
Sad CC noises. 
Thunks into the ground. No cell service down here… Nervous Mike. If Oliver tried to contact him while he was down here…
...and if he got stuffed into a suit...
He would be sent to night 4- 
-where he would get to suffer for 3 minutes because this is pre-patch-
-exactly. 
Mike is going to have a bad time.
“dOnT wOrRy- yOu DoNt CaNoNicAllY dIe tHeRe-” CC is getting dizzy-
“Then stop spinning!”
“N E V E R- I  W I L L  S P I N  U N T I L  I  D I E  A G A I N-” cue throwing up-
Cue mike being a good brother and returning, with a trashicani.
Throwing up CC noises. Fleeing BonBon noises.
Mike kinda just pats the bean’s back.
“... I think I'm gud now”
Mike offers a hand for the bean to stand with.
Bean accepts.
Mike heaves the bean to feet.
Bean is on his feet
Zaps Ballora.
Ballora noises
“... why?”
“Because yes.”
“... but why?”
Points at HandiUnit, who was just gonna make him do it anyways.
“Oh. Leapfrog.” 
‘What?” Confused Mike.
“... you would never understand.”
“Ohkay then.” Mike turns to other side and zaps the Fox.
Fox noises. Tap tap tappin’ on the, glass~.
Teleporting Fredbear Plush has joined the battle.
Mike waits for the vent to pop open and craws up towards Baby’s area. ZIPPY ZIP ZAPPITY THE BABY TO DEATH!
“... and what if I were Baby?”
“Then you wouldn’t be my little br- wait shit- Eli- I forgot about Eli-”
“M h m.” CC is now staring at Mike like he is an idiot.
He is an idiot, idiot-
Mike kinda just stares at HandiUnit waiting for him to order him to zip zap the bean.
“Shut up voice.”
Mike is wondering if he’d get docked on his pay if he zapped HandiUnit and fried the thing.
“Yes. Yes you would.” HandUnit noises.
“IT TALKS-”
“Yeah, yes it do.” Mike glares down at the thing.
Does anyone care if I possess it?
“YES WE DO CARE NOW FUCK OFF.”
Shadow bonnie fucking off noises.
“Who was that? Looked like teeth.”
“What-”
“T h e r e  w a s  a  t h i n g  w i t h  t e e t h-” *Flashback*
“Oh wai
t- oh its that stupid thing- excuse my brain, it isnt functioning properly.” 
“I- okay then.” Mike shrugs a bit and listens to HandUnit for a bit, trying to figure out what he’s supposed to do.
“You are done for the day- Leave.”
“Cool. CC you staying here?”
Debating CC noises. 
“I think I dont want to stay- yeah- I dont-”
“Kay. You wanna come stay the night with Oliver and I?” *Responsible Brotherly Vibes*
“O l i v e r? Who is the bean?”
“He’s my bf.” Grin.
“Kewl. He wont mind your dead brother staying with you right?”
“Probably not.”
“Goodie. I dont need to feel aw- wait- gonna feel awkward either way- but eh-”
“He seriously won’t mind.” Elevator door slides open. Mike steps inside and holds the ‘DOOR_HOLD’ button for the other bean to step inside.
Bean cartwheels in.
Mike lets the door shut. They zoom up to the surface like the elevator is on crack.
CC is casually spinning again- 
*Long stroll later*
*They have arrived at the bean’s place*
“wE hAvE aRrIvEd!” Dramatic voice of CC.
Mike unlocks the apartment door and lets the bean inside. Oliver ~appears to be in the bedroom~.
“So! Where is your boyfriend!”
“He’s probably in the bedroom.”
“... okay I will wait for him to come downstairs then-”
“We live in an apartment, bean.”
“Iknewthat-”
Mike just rustles the bean’s hair and closes the door, flips the lightswitch on. “Oliverrrrrrr~”
“dInO-” thunk.
“... You okay?”
“yEAH- where’s the first aid kit-”
Mike kinda just facepalms, goes over to the kitchen, grabs the first aid kit, opens the bedroom door, and tosses it at Oliver. It lands in front of the bean.
Oliver grabs ~stuff~ and ~heals~. Health bar is at 70%. “Thanks.”
CC is just awkwardly standing there.
~Oliver realizes that, A) He’s not wearing a shirt, and B) there’s a smol bean.~
~Throws blanket over self.~
“H i.”
“Hi. Who the hecc-” Muffled Oliver sounds. He emerges from the blanket cocoon with a shirt on.
“That would be CC.”
“H i.”
“Are you okay?” ~Cue Mike and Oliver staring at each other because they said the same exact thing at the same exact time, AGAIN~
CC just stands there regretting his decision.
“There’s ice cream in the freezer.” Again, ~Cue Mike and Oliver staring at each other because they said the same exact thing at the same exact time, AGAIN~
Ice cream isnt trustworthy. Stuffed… magic teleporting thing noises.
Oliver hand CC chocolate. “Is Chocolate trustworthy?”
CC is struggling. “.. this kinda looks like those movies where a child gets lured by ice cream.”
“I’m standing right here, bean.” Protective Mike.
“Dino’s right there. He won’t let me hurt you even if I wanted to. anYwAY, hAVE SomE choCoLaTe wHilE I gO TAlK tO tHE mAnGER AboUT mAyBe hAViNG heAT tHIS moNTH.”
“Fine. Also- Why do you call Mike Dino?”
“That’s a long story.” Mike kinda just shrugs. Stupid reasoning.
“I mean- there is time-” 
“We live in Dino Creek Apartments and it was my idea to live here. Actually the past few places I’ve found for us to stay in have had ‘Dino’ in the name.”
“Oh. So you are cursed with the name ‘Dino-”
“Yeah.”
CC is just casually eating the ice cream. 
Mike is seriously wondering why the bean said no to ice cream and then stole it anyways. He kinda just steps out of the bedroom, closes the door, and flops down on the couch. He clears a space for the bean.
Oliver has returned. “He said that unless we don’t want plumbing then we get to deal with having no heat. So I decided that water was important and didn’t say anything since we can’t afford bottled water.”
“Whut?”
Oliver kinda just looks at the bean. “We want water, we get no heat.”
CC is debating on whether to comment on the fact that Mike’s previous jobs went up in flames- literally-
Oliver is already aware of this fact. But he would prefer having a home to be in.
“Well- Mike does have a history with fire-”
“I am already aware of this.”
“He can just  m a k e  f i r e.”
Cue Oliver staring at Dino. “How easily.”
“...easily enough. But I didn’t want to burn down the apartment...”
“He made a bomb.”
Oliver wheezes. “WHA-”
“It’s a long story.”
“tO bE fAiR- iT wAs ReQuEsTeDiSh-”
“Is that why the McDonalds is still on fire???” Oliver staring at ~the bean~.
Insert Susie noises- “Y u p”
Oliver kinda just sits down. “Okay then. AnYwAY. F I R E ?”
Mike waddles over to le fireplace-esque thing. Fire has been created. Table has caught fire.
Fire has been put out.
“... You could say he knows how to make fire- just not a controlled one-”
“No kidding. Anyway. Heat. We have heat again.” *H U G*
*H U G  B A C K*
*Brainfreeze*
Mike hands CC a glass of warmish water between hugs.
*c h u g*
Mike notes that the entire fucking thing of ice cream has vanished.
Oliver notes that it’s time for him to go to work. Final hug for now and gO-.
“He knows im dead right?”
Oliver kinda just slowly turns around. “What? How can you be dead if you’re right here…?”
“It’s logic. Blame SC.”
 Oliver looks over at Dino for some help. “explAIN?”
Mike shrug.
“It’s called Shit From a Really Long Time Ago!”
Oliver nods. “Yea I get that. Anyway I gotta go or I’m gonna get fired.” Out the door.
Well that was interesting.
“Shut up Fredbitch.”
Mike staring at the child.
You never told him about it?
“Told me about what.”
“Fredbitch speak one more time and you are going in the fireplace.”
*Silence*
Mike is kinda just staring at the smol bean.
CC is giving the Stuffed Demon a death stare.
Mike follows CC’s gaze to the ‘Stuffed Demon.’ “wTF-”
“This is the thing that stalked me and ditched me. It lives now because apparently that is yes?”
“Okay.” Mike is staring daggers at the tiny little flammable object.
“Yeah. Bye hoom!”
Oliver slinks out the door, closes it, then *lock*.
“... I am debating throwing this thing in the fire anyways.”
I would rather not-
“Shush.”
“Ehm. So why do you exist?”
Because I can? 
“That’s not a good enough reason.” Mike has gotten up to go get some ~toast~.
Don't blame the thing for existing. Blame the creator.
“Whose the creator. aNd IF yOU sAy dAd- oR hENRY-”
Seems you know.
“Oh I swear to god- if he wasn’t already in that suit he’d be in ~danger~.”
“I thought he was in danger either way?”
“I’d rather he don’t consume my feet. Only animatronics do that- and cannibals- but any cannibal I encounter has died shortly afterward- for unrelated reasons...”
How many have died? Let me rephrase that. How many times did you end up like your father? 
“I said it was for unrelated reasons.” Mike shrugged. “Wasn’t me.”
What are those :sporkle: reasons :sporkle:
Waves in the general direction of Luci.
. . . Fair enough.
“hOw FaR aWaY iS oLiVeR?”
“Probably not very but if he’s not already at work he’s late so he’s probably hauling ass.”
“. . . alright. What are we gonna do for now?”
“Sit around, talk, and try to not pass out?” Mike suggests.
Kill some kids?
Mike just stares at Luci.
“Is that Dad?”
“No.”
“Sounds like him-”
“It does but it isn’t him I know this for a fact.”
“Are you gonna sleep?”
“s-” *snoring*.
CC debating if he is actually sleeping or not. *Poke*
Mike has no response whatsoever.
CC has decided he is asleep.
~To the NEXT NIGHT~
Mike yeets himself off of the couch and looks at the clock. Damn. “cCCCCCCC-”
“W h a t?”
“We’Re GOnnA bE lATE-”
Serves you right for trying to get some sleep.
“hE iS wOrKiNg tHe NiGhT sHiFt- hE wIlL sLeEp-”
Mike just grabs a snack, shoves his shoes on, and clicks the lights that WERE LEFT ON FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT off. Unlocc the door.
CC is vibing to eXoTiC bUtTeRs-
Mike kinda just puts the bean on his bacc and sprints- runs back lock door and then runs back to ~job~.
~T h e y  a r r i v e~
“hI kAreN cAn I pleASe hAVe ACcESS tO thE faCIliTY?”
“sIR, I dO BElIVe YOU’RE tREssPassIng ON prIvaTE pROpeRTY.”
“hE iSnT- hE iS thE tEk dOOd-”
“sIR GET OFF THE hoRSeS bACk.” Karen points from CC to the ground, then to the holding cell.
Well I dont like her.
LEt”S mAUl hER! Luci nods towards the flammable object and yeets himself at the Karen’s face.
Have fun- 
Karen peels the tiny demon off her face and tosses it into the trash. “Sir I do believe your cat is feral. Anyway, he’s not a problem anymore.”
“That wasnt a cat- that is not a cat-”
“And if it were a cat, H E H , you wouldn’t be standing- anyway.” *Punch punch the bitch because she’s not cooperating* Take keycard and r u n.
Luci ya gud? Small demon? 
Luci yeets himself out of the trash can and shoves a kleenex down the bitche’s throat.
Mike grabs the demon and goes. “Anyways, when she wakes up she won’t remember a thing because ~memory is shit and drugs~.” Swipe the kard and press the button. Sit while we go down because ~it takes forever~.
“... how much would you hate me if I played the Exotic Butters remix in here-”
Mike points towards the AUX_AUDIO_IN dock that Mike installed for phones. “Sure go ahead.” Mike is just looking down at his phone and his cell service gradually getting weaker. GOOD THiNG HE WAS BECAUSE OLIVER HATH MESSAGE HIM- Mike and Oliver are now texting back and forth.
*Exotic Butters remix intensifies*
Mike’s cell service has dropped out. Wifi is also unavailable.
CC is questioning if there is a way to play a spotify playlist in Mike’s apartment- through a speaker-
Mike is seriously wondering if CC really missed:
A) The speakers scattered around the apartment
B) The Phone Dock In THe Kitchen.
Anyway, Mike hopes CC doesn’t notice.
fORgIvE hIm fOr nOt iNsTanTlY lOoKiNg ArOuNd-
“Whut?”
Mike was questioning you-
“How did you know that PfFB-”
Because I can- its called :sparkle: being a little shit :sparkle: Besides- yOu kNeW wHaT hE wAs ThInKiNG-
“Yeah but only because of Luci.”
aNyWaYs- You should tell Oliver. 
“Yell Oliver what.”
T e l l, not Y e l l, and the shit with CC-
“FUCK- and what am I supposed to say, ‘yeah by the way my brother’s dead because I shoved his face into an animatronic in ‘83?’”
Your fault for not telling him before. And yes, that is exactly what you should say. Just maybe bring up the fact that you were drunk- iF tHaT wIlL hElp-
“This is going to be so much fuN-”
Dude it is your fault. Entirely.
Nodding Flammable Stuffed Demon.
The elevator lurches to a stop. Lights go out and the doors slam open.
*Angsty Teen noises*
Mike flips the switch on the back of his HandUnit to ‘OFF’.
awWwWwwWWWWw- dOnT lIkE tHe aNgStY tEeN?
“Do you really want to listen to him again?”
Sure- its getting bor-
“No- he doesnt-”
Luci yeets himself into the vent. Mike follows.
“wAs tHe vEnT cLeAnEd?” CC from the entrance of the vent-
I consumed the dead bodies. So yes.
“I meant from when I threw up- Did you consume my vomit?”
“Yea. It’s clean.”
No- 
CC is starting into the vent.
“You consumed my vomit?”
NO-
CC does not believe- but is in the vent now.
ZAp BalLoRA.
Possessed murderer noises.
“I wanna zap one- fOrGivE mE- CoNTrOllEd SHocK-”
Mike points out the fact that he hooked up a generator to the zappers. “It’s less controlled than you may think.”
“I still dont know why it is a ‘controlled’ shock- other than to make it sound better than it is-”
“I dunno. Anyway, I upped the voltage by about 50x. But go ahead.”
“... why did you up the voltage?”
“I’ll need it later.”
“... alright-” Z a p.
Skitter up towards Baby, do shit, then stuff all the beans under the desk.
SeE? gOoD pRaCtIcE- spoop voice.
Slide the panel closed while we wait for the dude to tell them to go do shit manually-
HU is off. Canonically and here.
Mike turns HU’s switch back to ‘HELL YEA!’.
HandUnit proceeds to tell him he will be offline. :>
“U S E F U L .” Hold the door thing closed.
“Is there something to punch in the face?”
Mini baby thing eyeball peeking through one of the holes.
“Yes.”
*P u n c h*
shE hATesSS USSSSS-
“SHE?”
“... Mike what do you have with you? I wanna dismantle it.”
Mike opens portal in the back of the chamber, yeets through, and points to the shelves upon shelves of tools.
*s n a t c h*
Mike crawls back through and makes sure the BiddyBab’s power switch is down towards ‘OH SHIT MY END IS NEAR!’.
“Y o u  w a n n a  r e w o r d  t h a t?”
SHE FUCKS USSSSS-
“.. Circus Baby?”
You, idiot.
“... dO i ReAlLy LooK lIkE a GiRl?” Staring at Mike.
“nO?”
hE fuCKs US iN ThE mIDdlE OF THE nIGHt hEEEEELLLlLLlP-
It is Mike’s turn to stare at CC-
CC is staring right back-
Mike kinda just slides the thing open and kicks the MiniBab thingy in the face.
yEEEEEEEEEEEE-
Mike is staring at the thing. “Is it okay?”
No, no it’s not. Luci noises.
*B o n k  t h e  b i t c h e s*
Mike kicks another one that was trying to consume CC. “hAnDUnIT We”ve bEEn WAiTIng fOR YOU tO Come BaCk sCREeEEEeeE-”
shE’S waTCHinG uS lET’S gO- *They yeet away*
“Yey they are gone-”
*Loud HandUnit noises*
Mike yeets himself through the vent.
CC follows.
Mike yeets himself at the vent cover expecting it to open. Since HandUnit hasn’t said ‘deactivating’ yet, he just faceplants into the cover. “jUST oPEN-”
“i wILL be DEAcTiVAtinG aND sHiT-”
Cover pops open and Mike yeets himself through, landing on his feet in a crouch. ~Mouse noises~
“What now?”
I cAN hEAR SomEoNE CreEpiNG thROUGh mY rOOM-
*H I S S*
Mike activates ~noise bombs~ scattered throughout the room.
sCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE- I wiLL ComMiT sTAB-
CC is attempting to not crawl back- 
Cue flashbangs. And Mike shoving the bean forward as fast as he can.
I WILL CONSUME YOUR TOES- Animatronic noises from behind them.
fLAShBAnGS TrIGGER-
fAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK-
CC has literally shut his eyes and yeeted himself at the door. He has now faceplanted into the door.
Mike yeets himself at the door, misses, and crashes through the wall instead. GoOd eNoUGH-
*Nightmare shoving his face through the fuckin’ wall vibes*
“L i f e  i s  p a i n.”
Mike is now committing attempted power restore. He’s waiting for ~the other writer~ to make FF be a ~bitchy birthday boi~
B I R T H D A Y  B O I-
Mike yeets BonBon at FF.
… wait that’s illegal- SIR THAT IS MY JOB- NOT YOURS-
Screechy Mike. Yeet BonBon hARDER, fAsTER, FARTHER-
I WILL NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE POWER SHIT BIRTHDAY HOOM!
“it’s not my birthday.” Click clICK-
CC having regrets in the corner.
WHEN IS YOUR BIRTHDEY THEN-
“CC you gud little one?”
“I am absolutely concerned-”
“sOmETIme iN MArCH- and sorry- whAT ShOULd I dO-”
. . . GUESS WHAT IT IS YOUR EARLY BIRTHDAY BURTHDEH BOI-
“Okay fine whatever idgas.”
NOW STOP MAKING THE BEEPING NOISES ITS FUCKING ANNOYING-
“But I’m trying to restore power…?”
S T O P  D O I N G  T H A T
Stfu- 
I WILL NOT HESITATE-
:)
Nevermind- 
“What you talk bout over there.’ A_ Grabbmnar died B_ Mike panykn no pankaek attenptionp. Mike is busy reading the thing on the screen that says “plEAse PrESs thE STARt ButtON.”
PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE-
No.
PLEASSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-
N-
*yeeting intensifies*
*crashing into the back of the power shit intensifies*
The panel is ~broken~
FUCK YOU FREDDY-
Mike sighs, bends down, and grabs rando wires. Jam them together and hope nothing explodes.
*mini explosion*
Mike is trying to not laugh. “I expected that.” trying to find the correct wires.
Hey no- I like that it shut up- dont get it to start again- just-  d o n t-
Mike has connected the correct wires. The building has power once again.
. . . fair enough. Goodnight. 
“If you’d like I can blow your fuses.” Mike lets that process for a second. “In the electrical way, I mean.” Holds up live wires.
… no- BonBon get your ass over here.
“I mean I have to deal with you later anyways, so you might was well just get turned off now.”
I SAID NO- 
“Okay. CC get over here.” Mike gestures towards ~insulated platform~. He is preparing to connect live wires to the ground in an attempt to kill the other bitch they have to get past to go home.
Freddy is a bitch and grabs CC’s arm.
NO- I SAID  N O-
Mike pries CC away from the animatronic and shoves the live wires into it. “DIE MOTHERFUCKER DIE DIE DIEEEEE-”
Freddy yeets BonBon in the way because he is :sporke: a bitch that refused to die. :sporkle: He is now running
Mike kinda just grabs BonBon from the air, sets him down, and yeets wires into Freddy’s ass. They melt there and begin ~uncontrolled shocks~ delivered through the ass every second.... at the very least that’s gonna melt the plastic ass and at most gonna fry the dude. Mike is hoping it fries the dude. Just in case he dances over to BonBon and boops the bowtie.
Freddeh and BonBon be ded now- and half of tomorrow’s work is done- 
Mike is just glad he won’t have to deal with BonBon being an ass tomorrow.
CC is already on his way out- he is absolutely sick of Funtime Freddy. 
Mike scrambles after CC. “fuCk THiS joB-”
“You’re the one that thought it was a good idea-”
“WE NEED THE MONEY-”
I CAN HEAR YOU IDIOT-
“SHUT UP BALLORA- S H U T  U P-”
I hEAR A mOUSe. I wILl eAT.
“I aint a mouse- Im a child. I promise there is a difference-”
Mike is attempting to pry open the security vent to the Control Module open, because it got locked. Somehow.
Skittering Ballora feet behind them growing ~closer.~
CC smaccing the wrench against the floor while running around like a maniac noises.
Mike decides that he can invent on the run. He follows CC while trying to build a mini robot. He needs to stop and sit down for a bit to do this.
CC continues to run around in the dark. CC has the urge to yeet himself at the spoopy bitch.
Mike skitters over to one wall and begins to wire up the little robot.
CC decides it’s a terrible idea and does it anyways. He has just yeeted himself and smacced the wrench against her face. 
Ballora is attempting to consume the child. And kind of succeeding.
Mike has yeeted his little suicide bot off into the darkness and screeches for CC to get the fuck off Ballora.
CC is now trying to get Ballora to let go of his aRm.
Ballora’s ARM proccessor (yes she runs on Linux shut the fuck up) has frozen and has let go of the arm. She won’t stay frozen for very long though because her Linux distro has crashed and is now trying to restart.
CC is officially off of Ballora and yeeting himself away.
The little bot is currently blasting fire at Ballora. Mike has yeeted over to the door thing and is attempting to open it. The bot is now charging up a set of C-4 EMP bombs. When that goes boom they ReALLY don’t want to be in the building. The bomb won’t really do any actual damage, just scar the ground a little, but they don’t want to be in the building because unprotected electronic equipment will be fried in the explosion. Cue rapid beeping and a little voice screeching, “OH FUCK OH FUCK ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA USE ME AS A SUICIDE BOMBeR?”
“TF IS THAT- sUiCiDe BoMbEr?! MIKE?! WHAT DID YOU DO THIS TIME?!”
“bAD THiNGs wE goTTA gO-”
“Have fun when I tell ya boyfren about today’s experience-” 
“yeA yEA-” Grab the bean and fucking SPRINT- through the veNT, iNTo THE elEvAToR, rApIDLy smAsh thE uP buTToN unTil thE elevAtoR yEEtS uP.
“... you’re absolutely crazy-”
“Nah, it’s ju-”
Boom down below.
“Well shit it wasn’t supposed to go off for another 25 seconds.”
Elevator lights flicker out and the elevator grinds to a halt.
“Well shit-”
“Oh great. Why didnt we stick to the plan where we yeet ourself into a vent and get to the other side?”
“I have no idea. Anyway.” Mike pulls out his phone. He has less than a bar of cell service, so… maybe he can send a text message. “Oh right CC sorry your phone’s totally dead, it’s not shielded like mine is. I’ll fix it later. And upgrade the shielding.” Shruggo. Mike has sent text to Oliver. “AnD nOw wE wAIt.” Mike is attempting to access Spotify. On 1 bar of 27g cell service. Yes. 27g.
“yOuR fAuLt fOr mAkInG aNoThEr BoMb-”
“If I haden’t you’d be ded.” music is now -barely- spewing from Mike’s phone. The signal keeps dropping out.
“For one- I probably shouldn’t even be here- I am already dead and logic broke and I am here- s e c o n d- She let me go- I could have just continued running around- sO nO- I wOuLdNt bE dEaD?”
“Okay ye you got me there. Oh hey Oliver’s on his way to rescue our asses.”
“You say that like this is normal.”
Mike just stares at CC like ‘yeah it is normal because I’m a smart idiot.’
CC is facepalming.
After a long bit of waiting, Oliver has arrived. Tapping on the roof of the still elevator. “i brOuGhT doNuTS.”
“YoU cAmE pRePaReD!”
“And I got a ladder too-” the elevator access hatch hath popped open. Ladder yeets down.
“How many times has this happened? You seem a little too prepared-”
“Once or twice. Not too many times.”
“wHy aRe yOu sO pRePaReD foR tHiS? Is he just a chaotic idiot all the time?”
“Nah but I’ve had my fair share of moments where wild assholes have kidnapped him.”
“I would like to hear this story.”
“He got kidnapped a year ago ish by some random dude named Vox. You may or may not know him.”
“... I dont remember a Vox.”
“He wasn’t nice, that’s for sure.”
“Let’s just go, the elevator should start working in the next 20 minutes. I don’t want to be in here when it tries to smoosh us.”
CC is climbing up le wall.
Mike stares at the bean, then looks at the ladder two feet to the bean’s left. He climbs that.
CC has been officially labeled a spider/gecko.
Mike has reached the top. Oliver has scampered up the wall just like CC. Why is everyone in Mike’s family a fucking spider-
The elevator has dropped down. Backup power in the building appears to be almost depleted.
CC yelps. Then he starts hissing at the dropping elevator. 
The elevator shaft emergency access hatch (WHICH IS STUPIDLY BEING HELD OPEN PURELY BY ELECTRICAL MOTORS I MEAN SERIOUSLY WHAT IDIOT-) slams shut since the backup batteries appear to be completely depleted now.
CC is screeching in Im About To Die Again, and Not In A Fire.
Mike is just trying to figure out if balsa wood can stop an elevator mid-fall. Oh wait he has steel on him ah yes let’s jam that here, mount it to the elevator roof thing (he’s on top of the elevator while Oliver is inside the elevator with CC-) and jam it against the wall. 
Rapid loud screeching from the elevator. “oLYSHITHOLYSHITHOLYSHITOLYSHITTTTTT_” They are still falling.
More screeching CC.
Mike remembers that this elevator was required to have an emergency STOP! lever (patents pending). YANK THAT MotHerFUCKER HARD. The very thicc and chomk steel bars snap out and slam against the wall, and the FRICTION!GENERATORs on the bars are now busy jumpstaring the backup generator in the elevator (so it can re-activate the electromagnets in the elevator.) Since the electromagnet rails in the elevator shaft are currently stuck in EMERGENCYSTOP mode (aka the electromagnets are in manual mode, meaning they won’t try to move the elevator along the rails, and are only being used to keep the elevator at a stop.) It’s all very complicated.
The elevator has screeched to a stop. Now that the elevator is completely stopped, those steel bars are holding it completely still. The backup generator in the elevator has shut down, all of the magnets have deactivated (even the ones in the elevator shaft). All is completely silent, except for the faint creaking and groaning of the bars straining against the sheer weight of the elevator. Anywho, it’s pretty damn quiet.
“...are you guys okay?” Mike is kinda shaken (he came *this* close to getting his arm chopped off by that damned bar).
“Im not double dead? So I think so?”
“Indeed not.” Oliver spiders his way down the wall. “We’re still alive. Anywho let’s see if we can get the elevator moving again.”
“You expect me to fix it for you, don’t you.”
“Yes, yes I do.”
“Iamnevertakingtheelevatoragain- Idunwanatakeitagain-” CC casually remembering panik is a thing- 
“I’ll make the elevator much better when I’m done with it. This only happened because of some shoddy USB-B connector failing...” Mike is currently tearing out the older computer control system for the elevator and a lot of the safety equipment that was mounted on top. Yes, he knows what he’s doing, shut the fuck up.
“Should I get out of here before you blow up the elevator?”
“I’m not gonna blow up the elevator, I’m just-” spark noises. The elevator is now rocketing up towards the surface. “THERE WE GO-” Mike drops into the elevator.
CC is panik again- why must it yeet itself- that’s his job-
They have arrived on the depart station. Oliver yeets himself out.
Mike follows.
CC has run past a wild asshole- and is just hoping he remembers the way back to Mike’s place because he dun wanna be there for another moment-
Mke, 5 minutes later, just unlocks the door and steps inside the apartment. There appears to be a CC-shaped hole in his wall now.
Oliver is concerned. “CC, ya gud?”
“Y   u   p.”
Mike looks through the pile of shit in the one corner and finds ~solid titanium~. Mount that to the wall until they can get someone to go fix the wall for them. GOOD ENOUGH.
I think he broke. Even after all hes been through, he finally broke- Idontgetthischild-
“Shutupfredbear-”
Oliver is staring wide-eyed at the bear that has appeared.
Hi. Im the plush that has stalked CC since… a really long time-
Oliver turns to CC very slowly. “Uh-”
“Dont mind him. Hes just a thing.”
Mike grabs the plushie and yeets him into the bathroom.
“Yup. Problem solved.”
Angry Fredplush noises-
Mike looks over to CC. “Do you care if I zap it?”
“Nope. Just dont kill it. I want it to die when I die again.”
“AGAIN?” Oliver’s eyes are huge.
“WEWENTOVERTHISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS” CC has flung imself at the wall. 
Cellular Motion Damping fields have stopped CC from plunging through the wall. CC is put down on the couch.
“... BUTIWANNAYEETMYSELFATTHEWALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL” CC is attempting yeeting himself- 
He is being held down.
Mike has plugged a big device into the wall outlet, releasing little stabbers from the side. He jammed them into the bear. He turned on the device. The bear is now getting constantly zapped with 25v 2a of electricitiy.
CC gave up on yeeting himself- for he is attempting kalm- 
Mike is waiting for a response from the plushie. Turn up the voltage!
The plushie is silent. Then it poofs into a different dimension.
Mike blinks.
The two electrified prongs fall onto eachother. The fuse in the device has blown.
Plushie has returned to CC- much smirk.
The plushie is immediately shocked with 3000 amps for a brief second. Definitely enough to cause medical issues but probably not long enough of a zap to kill the thing..
P o o f i n g  P l u s h
Oliver is watching te chaos.
Mike kinda just sits down with a sigh.
Stop tryna zap meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
“N E V E R.” The bear is being constantly zapped with 5v 2a now.
I WILL NOT HESITATE TO EXPOSE YER SECRETS- S T O P  Z A P P I N G  M E-
“What secrets are you referring to?” 
:sporkle: ‘83 :sporkle:
Mike has stopped zapping the bear.
T h a n k  y o u. The plush has returned.
Oliver is staring at Mike quizzically. “What happened in ‘83?”
“Doesn’t matter.”
Oliver does not believe Mike. “beAR tELL mEEEEEEE-”
I have a feeling that if I do im going to get zapped, so I will save it for when I am not in danger. 
“You’re gonna have a hard time getting that thing off of you.”
Oliver has sat down next to Mike and has turned on the TV. Kodi is refusing to work. *Grab the laptop and try to get YouTube to work*.
If you want answers- just get the shit off of me- tHeN nO dAnGeR-
“No.” Mike points out to Oliver that the Kodi control panel isn’t running on the laptop.
Im not asking you Mike. 
“I don’t take orders from you.”
Cue Oliver getting cold and leaning against Mike.
Mike has adjusted the way he’s sitting so he doesn’t fall over.
Oliver is content.
CC please help me- 
“wHy wOuLd I dO tHaT-”
. . . I have no idea. You are a good person?
“... Im not- but you can believe that-”
I wont yeet Nightmare into existence?
“yOu’D bE dOiNg yOuRsElF a fAvOr iDiOt-”
Mike and Oliver are watching this interaction like wtf is happening.
The heads still havent rolled yet- i CaN cHaNgE tHaT-
“That means you will suffer.”
I can poof away.
“... I will throw you into the fire.”
nOt iF I lEaVe fIrSt-
The bear has been paralized and can no longer poof.
oI fUcK yE-
“You’re welcome.”
I WILL SUMMON THE NIGHTMARE- lEmMe pOoF- oR nIgHtMaRe- Fredplush is slowly losing it.
“You can’t summon Nightmare either.”
I can try- icantry- i  c a n  t r y- if Susie can summon Henry- i  c a n  s u m m o n  N o o t m a r e-
The bear has been completely paralized including ~talking~.
Angry plush.
“tHiSiSfInE-”
The plush has been unparalyzed.
EOIA- oh I can talk-
Mike realizes that Oliver is slep. “Well shit.” Mike is now attempt to sleep. He is successful.
Plush is now attempting summoning a wild Nootmare while CC is getting foods.
Nightmare partially forms, says, “I wAS IN thE miDDle oF sOMeTHiNG wiTH fREddY-” and then immediately shuts up, realizing how that sounds. He has fully appeared.
Welcome. You are here for no absolute reason. Now according to the rules Phone bitch is gonna take you away soon- 
Several laser cannons drop from the ceiling, then turn on targeting lasers, which all center on Nootmare, and are now beeping shrill warnings at the bean.
NOOTMARE  F L E E- 
Nightmare refuses to flee. YOU SUMMONED ME I REFUSE TO LEAVE.
Fredplush has yeeted Nootmare away. Location: S i s t e r- 
Nightmare has yeeted himself back.
One of Mike’s AIs has disarmed the AI screaming, “DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-” The lasers have been disarmed and have retracted into the ceiling.
“... so that’s why he’s broke-”
“No, I mostly deconstructed broken animatronics to build the moving bits and just bought lots of handheld laser pointers and NERF guns. I cranked up the output of the laser pointers so they can set stuff on fire and blow up shit and stuffs. I just need the NERF guns to look meanacing.”
“You’re dangerously obsessed with fire-”
“This is not new information.”
“It doesnt need to be. Im just pointing it out again.”
“Mhm. Anywho, getting shot with one of those is gonna hurt a lot.” Wait Mike is supposed to be asleep- *CONTINUITy ERROR OOPS* Mike is sleep again. Crisis averted.
“Anyways. I see you summoned Nightmare. Want icecream?”
Nightmare nods. I’ll take some rocky road, if you have any.
“Lemme check.” CC has walked away again.
… well this doesnt feel like reality- 
Kid, when in this entire Google Doc has it seemed like the reality we come from.
1: Im not a kid. Im a plush. 2: … fair enough it hasnt- but this really messed up reality is even more messed- ya know what- n e v e r m i n d- WhAt wErE yOu doInG wITh FrEdDy?
Nightmare shrugs. Whatever it looked like, we were trying to kill all of the rats in CC’s home, wherever that is.
“Its called a nightmare. My nightmare house. With transparent cabinet doors apparently-” He has given him the rocky road icecream.
Nightmare has accepted the ice cream and shrugs. Kid, it’s your nightmare, you’re the one who came up with it.
But CC didn- Voice from the aether.
SHUT UP I AM SUPERIOR. Nightmare has yeeted himself through a portal.
“... bYe?”
Nightmare has yeeted himself back.
“hI?”
Bitches needed a slappin’.
Oliver has awoken 2 minutes before he needs to be at work. He has vanished. Mike is now awake.
*Four minutes later*
Oliver shoves his face through the door. “whO tEH fuCC-”
“Meet Nightmare. A nightmare that I created while dying.”
Nightmare hath turn to Oliver and waves. Odd static noises.
STAHP IMITATING ALASTOR FOR GOD”s SAKE-
Nightmare has yeeted a certain plushie through a portal at Foxy’s face. Since the Fox is again trying to beat Expert+ he don't catch it.
Plush has yeeted itself back. exCuSeEE mEE?
The assembly lineKeeps on churning until we are oneNightmare by design~ Oh you’re back.
Oliver is gone again.
Mike has passed out again. Please for the love of god Nightmare fuck off so we can skip to the next night-
Anyways- s l e e p o v e r?
Nightmare agrees to slepovr.
Mike agrees even though he’s asleep.
TILL THE VERY NEXT DAY- 
Mike yeets himself over to the elevator.
Nightmare yeets with them.
“dO i hAvE tO TaKe tHe eLeVaToR-”
:Yes I fixed it for a reason.”
“iT sPaRkEd- aNd I fLeD-” 
Mike picks up the bean and walks onto the elevator.
Screeching bean.
Elevator calmly dives down into the abyss.

Flashback:
aNyWaYs- You should tell Oliver. 
“Yell Oliver what.”
T e l l, not Y e l l, and the shit with CC-
“FUCK- and what am I supposed to say, ‘yeah by the way my brother’s dead because I shoved his face into an animatronic in ‘83?’”
Your fault for not telling him before. And yes, that is exactly what you should say. Just maybe bring up the fact that you were drunk- iF tHaT wIlL hElp-
“This is going to be so much fuN-”
Dude it is your fault. Entirely.
Nodding Flammable Stuffed Demon.
E n d  o  f l a s h b a c k
Mike is staring at CC. “Did you do that?”
“dO wHaT?”
“THE FLASHBACK-”
I  d i d. UvU
Mike has dropkicked the plushie. “fuCK yoUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-”
DONT CHALLENGE ME-
Mike shrugs. “I challenge who I like.”
The plush has disappeared.
“Oh great. hEs gOnE-”
“Is this a bad thing?”
The elevator is slowing down.
“After your conversation, definitely bad.”
The elevator is moving a lot slower now.
Nightmare is concerned. Is it supposed to do that?
Mike nods. “The new system I put in place gradually slows down the elevator car. If there’s a sudden power loss, the system automatically brings the elevator to a full stop immediately.
“At least it isnt gonna drop again- r i g h t  M i k e?”
“Correct. If it’s at risk of dropping the system will sound an alarm and the system will kick on over 60 magnetic systems to bring the elevator to a stop.”
“And does the weight of combined people on the elevator matter?”
“Short answer, no.”
“... l o n g  a n s w e r?”
“It’s complicated but if we have multiple animatronics on the elevator it may be possible to overload it.”
“... does a giant nightmare animatronic count?”
“Uh, Nightmare how much do you weigh?”
Like three tons.
“Well shit. Yeah the magnets should be able to stop the eeva elevator but it’ll take like a minute.”
“... i wOnDeR iF hE cAn tUrN iNtO a pLuShIe- lIkE fOxY-”
Nightmare is immediately in Plushie form. oH FUCK YOU TOO-
“That solves so many problems. And I have no idea what I did- oH wElL-” S M I R K-
Amgry plooshie noises.
Mike shrugs. “That solves that problem I guess.”
Welcome to the world of being a plush. 
hOW tO mOVE.
Ask- nopenopeshutup- CC might kno-
“I dont.”
I have no idea. I  j u s t  c a n.
Nightmare angrily yeets himself at CC. oH HEY I CAN MOVE? TIME TO YEET AROUND! Yeet yeet yeet. This fucking plushie of Nootmare is just flinging around randomly and Mike is very concerned. Did he accidentally inhale meth or something?
If Scrappy gave him some, then probably-
SPRINGBOI ISN”T HERE RIGHT NOW. CHECK YOUR MODEM OR ROUTER AND TRY AGAIN.
YEET YEET YEET YEEET.
The elevator has slammed to a halt. Waaaaaay before it was supposed to. Mike checks the system. They’re still several hundred feet above the facility.
“If you tell me you broke the elevator-”
“IDFK.” Mike is currently hacking into the control panel.
Facepalming CC.
Mike has connected his phone to the control system and is kinda just staring at the numerous errors scrolling across his screen.
“Whydidiagreetothis- w a i t  I  d i d n t-”
“it’s fine it looks like it just froze. If I do this, we-”
*Elevator lights go out*
“-should start moving after it restarts-”
Elevator is moving again. The lights have returned to living.
“I will admit. This is terrifying.”
Mike nods. “It’s certainly not great.” Elevator lights go out again and the elevator has snapped to a stop. “SHIT-”
Should I be as scared as pre-death CC?
“Im going to try and not take that as an insult.”
“Nah, I probably just plugged something in wrong.” He taps something on his phone and the elevator hatch pops open/ He lifts himself up into the elevator shaft. He is now standing on the top of the elevator. C H E C K   T H E    W I R E S. The elevator, of course, is now dropping because the batteries ~died.~ It’s a controlled fall though. They’ll lightly bounce off of the bottom of the elevator shaft and come to a stop later.
“Is it working or are we dying?”
The elevator is now start-stop-start-stop-start-stop-start-stopping over and over very rapidly.
“Wearedyingalright- Do you still have enough internet to text your boyfren goodbye?”
Mike stares at CC pointedly while he yanks down on one of his emergency stop bars.
Elevator is now yeeting 50x faster.
*The writers got sick of this broken ass elevator. So to save everyone some time, we are skipping to night 5.*
“See this is big brain. Going into a room, sending Elizabeth to the scewper, and then following her mysterious voice. According to all of horror, this is a very good idea!”
“Yes yes, it’s a terrible idea. We all know I die in the next 5 minutes but HEY WE’RE BEING CONTROLLED BY PEOPLE WE DON’T EVEN KNOW SO WE HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH IT!”
“Ya know what- just walk in, let her have her speech, and then either walk to the side or out of the room. Wait- this is horror- you aint ever gonna do that-” CC questioning unlife decisions. 
Mike shrugs. “Y’all just dive to the side or something- for the sake of the universe and plot and shit I must die.”
“WHAT”S THIS I HEAR ABOUT YOU DYING?”
Its fine. Elizabeth ends up having regrets and brings him back to life by saying ‘You wont die’ over and over again- its almost annoying! Oh and remnant is a thing-
Oliver is staring at the bean.
Mike sighs and punches the little panel Liz is ordering him to carefully enter a code into.
i tOLD yoU tO bE cAReFul iDIOT- bALllORA fuCK oFF.
We all know Ballora aint here- just cut the act so we can just watch Mike die- 
“You’re an idiot-”
So are you-
Mike punches the control panel again. “JUST ACCEPT THE CODE MOFUKR- sorry sis-”
I don’t recognise yoU- yOU mUSt bE nEW-
“STOP QUOTING THE FUTURE GOD DAMNIT-”
“Didn’t you already say that- Sis you broken?”

CC has given up and is about to yeet the HandUnit into another universe. Or maybe just break it. That also works.
Mike conveniently already hacked into EVERY FUCKING HANDUNIT the night before and has fried all of them now. Problem is, since the universe is forever stuck looing up here, we never get to this point. Fuck that tho we wanna keep rping so SHADDUP WIF YER LOGGIC-.
(*Pankek: :>*)
(*Kytten: I am aware that I have just caused the entire universe in the RP to no longer exist after that point but do I seem like the kind of person who cares about that? The rest of this is for YOUR benifit AND our own so SHUT and we will pretend the universe is perfectly normal :)*)

FNaF 6 (Pizzeria Simulator)
Mike has connected his phone to the building’s speakers. Let’s pull up his long-ass list of songs… and play, oh, Idk, ~Pain~ by Three Days Grace.
Fuck it.
High Hopes it is-
“W h y.” 
“Because I can. And we don’t have to deal with any animos.” The modem in the corner is screeching.
“... This is- Cant you play a better song? Or one that we havent listened to in the last 30 minutes?”
“Sure fine.” Mike is now playing some random song off of Bonnie’s Spoitify playlist.
Count the Ways is playing.
“... y e s-”
alL IS WELL IN THE AFTON FAMILYYYYYYYYYYYY~ wait wrong song.
Mike is staring at the plush.
“Can I just say- a l l   i s  n o t  w e l l-  a l l  i s  h e l l-”
INTHEAFTONFAMILYWEFUC-
Mike has dropkicked the plushie.
“An appropriate response.”
Nightmare has yeeted himself at CC. uP thE pANt lEG-
Mike is kinda just like ‘great’.
CC is questioning if there is anything sharp in here.
Mike points to the very sharp gopher netting over the vents *which is suspiciously got holes punched right through them*.
CC has snatched his scissors- dont question it- one must always have those on them- and decides they will work better-
Nightmare has yeeted up to *near* where CC should be smart enough to not stabb.
CC is about to do what he did to Foxy when he refused to allow them to leave FNaF 3-
Nightmare has yeeted to where CC SHOULD be smart enough to not stabb.
“Nightmare you have three seconds to get out. Or you wont exist for a day.”
Nightmare is happy where he is.
Mike is just watching like ‘oh gods’.
Nightmare has been poofed from existence. 
CC just has this fake smile on his face and twitchy eyes. Hes done with the bullshit.
Nightmare immediately reappears.
CC is about to yeet himself back outside- then he decides not to-
Nightmare decides to perch himself next to PfFB.
Demon Plush doesnt know whether to facepalm or just ignore it. 
Nightmare internally grins.
“S o  w h a t  y o u  d o i n g  M i k e?”
“I’m trying to hack into the company’s network.”
“... Im not even surprised-”
“They’re withholding info from us AND I WANNA KNOW WHY.”
Nightmare has hopped on top of PfFB and has yeeted himself (and the Flammable Thing) down a vent.
Screeching Flammable Thing.
Mike kinda just stares down the vent. “what tHE fuCK-”
“If you stop questioning it, it stops being weird.” Casually lying to himself.
Mike does not believe the bean.
The bean doesnt believe himself either.
PfFB has been yeeted back to the office.
Demon is hiding.
Nightmare has self-yeeted back to the office.
Mike has successfully hacked into the company network and is now ransacking their databases.
And this is the point in which we move to another doc, for this doc is crying.
Yeah- so if you’re reading this- you’re on the wroooooooong doc.
Mike looks up after doing this and jumps back.
Scrap Freddy’s eyes have followed Mike up and have locked on him.
“iS thAT nORmAL?”
“yOu tHiNk i kNoW aNy mOrE tHaN yOu?”
“nope.”
“BEGIN AUDIO PROMPT IN 3, 2, 1.”
Is now playing a slightly different warbling thing from the first audio prompt.
“Document Results.”
Scrap Freddy has not moved.
Mike checks no and looks up.
Scrap Freddy is now leaning on the table and up off of the chair now.
Mike yeets himself away from the table. “hOLY fuCKiNG shIT-”
“W h y  i s  i t  m o v i n g- I  d o n t  l i k e  i t-”
“iDFK BUt I doN’T likE iT eIthER”
“oI sToP mOvInG wOuLd yA?”
Mike is debating whether he should zap the bitch.
Z A P.
K a l m. The pile of wires is kAlM.
“BEGIN AUDIO PROMPT IN 3, 2, 1.”
Warbling Freddy noises from the deathbox.
Pile of Wires on the outside: … *silence*
Pile of Wires on the inside: Please shut up- p l e a s e- s t f u-
The cassette tape appears to have gotten stuck in a loop and is now stuck blasting the thing forever.
The Pile of Wires is considering breaking the rules and breaking the cassette tape.
CC is about to do it for him.
“How much trouble would you be in if I broke this thing?”
“Probably quite a bit.” 
“Well are you done with it? Can I go yeet it into another room?”
The cassette tape is broken now.
“T h a n k  g o o d n e s s-”
“Yea.” Mike is wondering if he can just accept the bean without doing the checklist. Fuck it. “HElp me drag this thing into the scrapping room-”
“Idunwannatouchit-”
Mike points to the AnimatronicAGrabs (Patents Pending). “yOU dON’t hAvE tO.”
“. . . I’ve stopped trusting the things you have access to when you blew up the first place-”
“Seriously?”
“You have a habit of… blowing things up- or getting dangerously close to starting fires- oH aNd bReAkInG eLeVaToRs-” 
“...”
“You’re gonna look at me and tell me im wrong?”
“No. How are we supposed to move it…?”
“I dUnnO- maybe we leave it here? We are probably missing some very important information!”
“Probably. BUT THE TAPE IS BROKE. Should we just leave it?”
“Y e a h-  l e t s  l e a v e  i t  h e r e-”
“It seems you are considering going against your  first choice, to salvage the item. This is unacceptable. You must complete the maintenance checklist and salvage the animatronic.”
“I- it’s working again? Should I be scared?”
“uH yEAH- ThE pOWer coRd iS dISconnECtED-” Mike points to the fact that the power cord got yanked out at some point.
“... at least it isnt looping- but you get to handle being near both of those things- imma go wait by the door.” 
Mike stares at CC. “Coward.” mumble mumble. Punch the animo in the face. Play the tape again.
“Call me a coward, but im just being smart. The cassette is haunted.”
“Yes, yes it is…” Mike glares at the cassette tape. WRONG MOVE. NOBODY’S LOOKING AT THE ANIMATRONIC AND MIKE IS RIGHT THERE-
CC sees it move out the corner of his eye- insert screech-
lE sCrEeChY cHiLd hAs bEeN lOoKeD aT bY thE pIlE oF sPaGhEtTi-
Mike has fallen away from the ‘tronic. He is fear. “whAT THE FUCK-”
Nightmare has yeeted himself into VR to say hi to the other flammable object.
The flammable object has hidden himself in a place nobody will suspect. He will not be found. UvU.
Nightmare yeets right to the prize counter. Hi!
DAMMIT- I was so sureeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee- T^T
I don’t think anyone else is gonna look here though. But it might be smart to yeet yourself into the DLC or something. I don’t think they’ll want to visit it.
This place doesnt even exist.
So? We’re literally in the game.
S o  t h e y  w o n t  c o m e  h e r e- its called time travel. They cant do it UvU.
Have you been paying attention to: A) The writer’s plans for them, B) the fact that they’ve been time traveling this entire time?
… well shit im dumb- bUt i aM sTiLl sMoRt eNoUgH tHaT tHeY cAnT fInD mE- yOu’Re aN eXcEpTiOn-
… what if they plushify Oliver…?
Then I am going to have many regrets. 
Anywho let’s mentally stalk them and see what they’re doing!
~Stalking~
“-tHAT iS nOT oKAY THIS thING nEEdS tO sTOp moviNG-”
“iTs a DeMonNNnNnn- kIlL iT wItH hOlY sHiT-”
*... oh hell- they’re out of their minds-*
“WhERE thE fuCk DO wE gET hOLY ShIT-”
*...this is insane...*
“ThE hOlY cOw, dUh!"
“Oh my gOD-” Mike is concerned.
*What the fuck are they doing*
*I would like to say they are drunk but thats definitely not the case. They have lost it.*
*No shit sherlock.*
“Anywho, we gotta yeet back into the aether until the next night.”
“Yesletsgetthefuckouttahere-”
Mike is yeeting out of the world. ~Aether portal is open. Waiting for 2 entities to enter.~
CC has yeeted.
Oliver has yeeted.
~Aether portal has been closed.~
~N E X T   N I G H T~
Mike has yeeted back into existence.
Oliver is close behind.
They have yeeted over to the office.
CC has crashed into the chair. “... oW-”
Mike has managed to noclip partially into a wall. “HELP-”
“I- hOw-”
“I’M spEffLE- LeAvE mE aLonE- actually don’t, please help-”
“wElL hOw dO i dO tHaT?”
“Hold on.” *Yeets away* *yeets back*.
*s t a r e*
“I’m not stuck in the wall anymore!
“nO yOu aRe nOt-” CC trying to not be concerned, but failing miserably-
“:)”
“jUsT-” Intense thinking. “dO tHe ThInGs yOu’Re sUpPoSeD tO dO-”
Mike is now busy ordering plates.
“Do you know what happened to the pile of wires?”
Mike hears a clang in the vent. FLIP OVER TO THE MOTION SENSOR REALLY FAST AND HIT THE BOOP.
Motion detected.
Mike turns of the ac and the computer. “There’s your answer.” *Shines flashlight in vent*
“Oh. I thought you wouldnt have to deal with this-”
“That was before we salvaged the animo.” Mike shrugs.
“G r e a t.”
“So what are we supposed to do-” temperature icon is flashing. Mike appears to not have noticed.
“M i k e.  S o m e t h i n g  i s  b l i n k i n g.”
Mike scrambles to turn on silent ventilation.
“... how bad of an idea is it for me to try and attack the pile of wires?”
“A very bad idea.”
“E x p l a i n.” Bronze battle axe has been summoned. *b l a m e  g o o g l e*
“The pile of wires is made up of individual wires, correct? So if you attack it the wires will just bend around the weapon and your attack will be ineffect- hoyfuckingshitoyou’reinsane-”
“You’re a rotten grape arsonist, Liz is a manipulative clown, and Dad is a murder furry. We all have problems. :>”
Mike is wheezing. “I- I can- can’t argue- with that- Oh shit when do we have to deal with dad again-”
“As long has he doesnt try and a limb, we shall be fine-”
“He’s been waitin’ abandoned and patient for so long~, long~, long~, long~, a savege mask ghost story from the past~” Speakers are now blasting Follow me.
Mike stares at his phone. “Did you KNOW we were talking about dad??”
The phone briefly pauses then plays.
Mike stares at his phone. “Uh-”
“Oh great everything is haunted.”
“I highly doubt my phone is haunted, probably just had one of the AIs go sentient.”
“P o s s i b l y.”
Mike looks at the phone for confirmation. The phone switches from Follow Me to Die In A Fire.
“I t  w a n t s  t o  k i l l  u s- or knows our music taste-”
The phone is now trying to ship the two songs together. Smishy smashy smash.
CC doesnt know whether to be concerned or not. He has decided he is concerned, but is afraid to voice it out loud-
“...is my phone shipping William and Chica?”
Phone screen flashes Chilliam for a brief moment before going back to Spotify.
Mike does not know how to react.
CC is about to break Mike’s phone.
Susie is staring from wherever the fuck she is- she is not amused.
Mike has turned off his phone’s AI.
The phone flashes “Go fuck yourself. Or Oliver. IDC.” and then turns off.
CC is holding in a snort-
Mike is red. “uh-” rapid coughing and wheezing.
CC looks at Oliver- and then Mike- repeat-
Oliver’s face is kinda like ‘ohshit’
Mike is not making eye contact with CC and is now busy ordering plates. And occasionally sending a murderous glare at his phone. He’d give that AI a harsh talking to later. Maybe pull at Matt. Excluding the whole giving birth to a murderous furry thing.
“Back to the question. Is it a bad idea for me to attack the pile of wires?”
“Why don’t you find out.” Mike waves at the pile of wires somewhere down the vent, unless it moved. He doesn’t know nor does he care.
CC has yeeted himself into the vent.
Oliver has grabbed CC and has prevented him from getting himself killed. “No deth.”
“I wont be double dead- jUsT aTtAcKiNg tHe pIlE oF wIrEs- pErFeCtLy sAfe-”
Oliver lets CC go. “Fine-”
CC is out of sight.
Oliver and Mike have decided to hack the internet.
5  m i n u t e s  l a t e r-
Yeah I kidnapped the child with a battle axe- *sounds from vent*
Mike and Oliver are currently busy. Please come back later and see if they’re available.
Unamused CC noises.
Mike and Oliver have not noticed anything is wrong-
The Pile of Wires decides to try and add Oliver to the kidnapped list.
The Pile of Wires is promptly kicked in the face. Mike and Oliver have gone back to their activities.
The Pile of Wires remembers jumpscares are a thing. *i n h a l e*
The Pile of Wires has been given a warning look.
The Pile of Wires retreats- *planning intensifies*
They are haccing.
The AI in Mike’s phone is just watching the chaos.
Plan has been made.
Mike and Oliver are busy hacking into the internet.
They’ve finished up and are now going to save the child. They yeet off and have located the Pile of Wires.
“H i   C C. Wait you’re not here- WIRES WHERE YOU YEET MEH BEAN-”
“At another pizzaria stalker, why?”
The Pile of Wires has been set on fire.
Pile of Wires is now attempting to put out said fire- 
Mike has disconnected the Pile of Wires’ ~processor~. “Have fun being offline.” Yeet off through the universe to find the child.
Child is very secure and hidden.
...Mike yeets to the prize counter in HW-
Screechy Demon Plush- it has poofed to the DLC-
Yeet on over to Vanny’s home-

“hI-” *Yeet away to SB*

Mike has hit a wall. Then, *brain moment*
Mike yeets back to Security Breach and is hunting for the Freddy.
Murder Bunny noises
Mike has revoked Murder Bunny’s knife-weilding permissions.
“Oh hi Gregory-”
“-”
“GIMME MY KNOIF-”
Knife has been yeeted into the bunny’s face-
Angry Murder Bunny noises
NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN THE FACE- BITCH-”
Mike has this look on his face:
Mike has yeeted away. Mike has yeeted back to the Pile of Wires. “FREDDY GIMME THE CHILD.”
“
I DONT HAVE THE CHILD
“WHERE. IS. THE. CHILD.”
SOMEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE.
“Tell me exactly where the child is. Right. Now.”
You’re the one that chose to wait.
Mike has connected electrified wires to the bean at a low voltage. “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. Either way, i’m fine with it.”
Pile of Wires has shut itself down.
The security precaution Mike has previously uploaded to the bean has forced it to turn back on. It can no longer shut itself down.
Excuse me, Ballora can handle this.
Mike has upped the voltage. And the bean can now feel pain, thanks to that lovely little file called MikeWantsToKnowYourLocation.exe. That same file has also erased the bean’s memory of the ‘Excuse me, Ballora can handle this.’ moment. The bean must now cooperate since its system is being flooded with copies of MikeIsGoingToStabYou.exe. (It’s a virus). When nothing happens Mike simply disconnects the bean’s power supply. It is now off. He’s not getting any answers from this useless motherfucker. He decides to call CC’s phone. “cC where are yOUU-”
Phone rings on the table. Insert CC voicemail. “Idk how ya got mah number, but no, im not buying ya shit-”
Mike has resorted to the tracking chip in CC’s neck.
His phone just says ‘Trying to connect. Connected. Establishing Position.’
Mike waits impatiently.
Mike remembers something and yeets off to go rip off Lefty’s head. He arrives. Turn off Lefty and pop open the head. “H A I.”
Sleeping CC noises-
Silent hissing Puppet noises.
Mike has levitated CC into the air and leaves Lefty to his own devices.
Excuse me what godly power have you obtained- Puppet is trying to snatch CC back. Grab le foot. Send to second location intensifies.
The Puppet is now covered in nanobots who are now forcing the puppet into a smol little ball and keeping it there. It’s probably not gonna hurt it but it’s definitely uncomfortable.
Go back to activating the tracking chip. His Phone is trying to connect to the nanobots.
Mike is waiting for his damn phone to establish a connection to the nanobot’s VPN. It’s taking forever to do so.
Oh joy, an error. It reads as “Cannot establish a stable connection the the FuckeryNanobot VPN you are trying to connect to due to a timeshift connection error. Cannot get location until the nanobots are in a stable timeframe. Please wait, as we are redirecting the nearest black hole to bring the nanobots back into normal time. This may take a couple of minutes.”
CC waking up and questioning everything- he has been yeeted successfully- 
His phone beeps with a connection successful alert. “ArE yA gOnnA eStABlISh A loCATioN oR whaT-”
All his phone screen is saying is “Fazbear Frights Book 1 Story 1”
“wTF doES thAT mEANnnNNNnnn-”
“haVE yOU nOT reAD thE BOOks?” Oliver be stare at Mike.
Mike realizes he’s not wearing pants and is now under the desk grabbing them. “No-”
“yEEt To tHIS plAcE- AND tiME-” Oliver yeets the book at his face.
Mike has shoved pants on and has yeeted to go rescue his bean.
Ehm.
In this case, ‘bean’ is CC.
Just making sure.
Mike has yeeted into a very angreh bunbun. Yeet over to the cursed ballpit. Shove head inside. “cC yOU thEre?”
“Ye-” *silence*
Mike has yanked the bean from the ballpit. oh great now they’re in 1985- g r e a t. Mike grabs the bean and is fear.
That moment when you realize that Mike somehow has a teleporting ability- “... what kind of godly power have you obtained-”
“They’re called N A N O B O T S and I can bend the fabric of reality, remember? Hol on lemme yeet us-” Mike has yeeted them back. Not far enough. Yeah no let’s not let CC see past him and past Oliver doing that- forward in tiME- They have arrived back in normal time. Mike smacks straight into Oliver, and fortunately, CC is yeeted slightly to the left so he hits the padded wall :).
uuuuUUUUNfortunately Mike knocked Oliver over, soooo they fall- Mike *of course* lands on top. *Mike yeets off a little too late-*
CC crawling into the vent to try and find his axe-
“CC nO- don’t do this again-”
“B u t  m y  a x e-” CC is not waiting for an answer. He is off to find the bronze axe that appeared out of nowhere.
Mike shrugs. “I give up trying to control him.”
CC has returned. “Seems as though the Pile of Wires is dead-”
“I yanked his power.”
“Ah. When are we summoning dad?”
Mike has finished with all the shit. “Lesh go summon.”
“G r e a t. :>” 
Mike has yeeted himself to the room with dad in it-
CC has been yeeted.
Mike is loading the cassette tape in.
CC is commiting stare at the footh.
“Before you is-”
“ShUSH-”
“Beginning audio prompt in 3, 2, 1.” Warbling noise.
Scrappy’s eyes click down toward the cassette tape in minor annoyance., then back up towards Mike, eyes saying “why the fuck are you doing this we all know i’m in here and we all know I’m gonna bite yer nose.”
“If it makes you feel any better, we hate it too-”
That does actually make it better-
Mike notes that the footh’s voice is much more struggle. “You don’t sound to great-”
“You blew him up-”
“Good point.”
Scrappy rolls his eyes again. And set me on fire. So yeah, not doing to great. tURN thAT damN THIng OFF-
Mike goes to turn off the tape.
Scrappy is now less than an inch from Mike’s face.
Mike recoils back. ‘hOLY-”
“N O  B I T E-”
Scrappy noises. i aM thE foOTh I dO whAt I wiSH oH shIT NO- The suit has self-activated and is now doing a pre-programmed sequence of hellos. sTAhP sATahp sTAHAShAHAShp-
*W h e e z i n g  C C*
Mike is struggling to not laugh.
The suit has deactivated. fuCK yoUUUUUUUUUU- Lunge towards Mike the instant he looks away-
Mike attempts to yeet away but he is trap in chair. Stare at the bean and hope he don’t move. Being this close to an avocado is ery uncomfortable. “cC-”
What, no hug?
CC is trying to decide whether chopping off the head is the best idea- then he remembers Mike has a job to do- 
Mike is annoyed. “cCCCCCccCcCcC-” Makes the mistake of looking away for half a second.
Scrappy is now about an inch away from Mike and his arm is bent around the bean, but not touching. Mike is in danger.
“CC GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE AND HELP ME!”
CC has snatched the taser- now to shoot-
Mike is impatiently waiting for the bean to zap the footh.
CC I swear to god if you shock me I will ground you-
“Sorry, you have no power over that anymore. UvU.” Z a p.
Scrappy is now back in the chair.
Mike has yeeted away. He has checked ‘holy shit yes’/
“For future reference, may I chop off heads?”
NO-
“YES-”
ABSOLUTELY NOT CHILD-
“ABSOLUTELY-”
“Great. Head chopping it is.”
CC you’re grounded.
“Cc you’re ungrounded.”
GROUNDED.
“STFU-” Mike zaps the footh.
“yOu sToPpEd hAvInG gRoUnDiNg pOwErS yEaRs aGo-”
I HAVE MURDER POWERS- Lunge at the beans.
“You’re not allowed to move. We’re staring right at you.”
fuCK iT- YEET YEET AT THE BEANS WITH THE SPIKE ARM.
CC has smacced his axe into Scrappy’s face.
Scrappy’s scrap value has decreased by 20 dollars. He is now back into the seat.
“Begin audio prompt in 3, 2, 2, 5, 1.” Screeching noises.
CC refuses to not look at Scrappy. “nO mOvInG biTcH.”
Scrappy is pissed. sTFU- WHO MADE THESE AUDIO PROMPTS- I WANNA IMPALE THEM-
Mike has that Alastor face again.
CC has commited wheeze again.
Mike shrugs and checks ‘don’t know’.
“Begin murder- I mean audio- prompt in 3, 2, 1.” More warbling death noises.
“PFFT- dAd dId yOu mAkE tHeSe?”
Why would I subject myself to this?
“Because you thought it would be funny to torture the other pizzaria stalkers?”
Mike points out the fact that Scrappy had been trapped in a back room when tapes were a thing. Because the timeline is so twisted and waves throughout time.
CC points out that time and logic broke when Chica became a thing.
“True, true. But still, he didn’t make them-”
We know what scares you, when you’re awake~ we see your eyes going wide when we meet face to face~ oh sorry I was just singing to myself don’t mind me-.
“Meh- then probably Mike’s new fren-”
“Wut-”
Huh? New friend?
“Dont question and shush im tryna get Spotify working-”
Mike points out that they have neither internet or cell service in this room.
CC leaves the room, starts Its Me, turns the volume all the way up, and comes back. 
Scrappy is debating weather or not to consume himself.
“Kay so now what.”

Mike has yeeted himself toward Oliver.

“WHAT THE FUCK-”
Dead bodies are now spewing forth from the tear in spacetime. We are legally obligated to mention they are on fire.
Oliver has appeared next to Mike. He apparently yeeted back into the void at some point and returned. “whO tEh fUcc sToLE fErAl’S dEAD bODies? hE wAS goNNA eAT thEIr EyEbAllS fOR dinnER-”

A plushtrap has been yeeted into existence- 
Mike is fear.
Plushtrap yeets into the vent.
Several more Plustraps have been summoned.

More zapping.
Scrappy’s internal shielding is being overloaded very quickly. FUCK OFF.
“N E V E R” Jeremy has yeeted.
M o r e  z a p p i n g.
Scrappy’s internal shielding is about to fail. It is currently having to store a large portion of the shocks in capacitors which are all almost full. His internal shielding is glowing red hot from how much electricity its refracting out into the air.
Zap Zap Zap Zap Zap Zap.
Scrappy is beginning to slow down because his systems are now being overloaded.
The void has yeeted The Overgrown Baby and Lefty into the battle.
Scrappy has dodged into a different vent and is moving as fast as possible. This is actually good because it’s consuming more power than normal. So. His capacitors are being drained a lot faster than normal.
The void has sped up the process of time passing- it is currently Saturday-
Scrappy is great fear.
Fritz has yeeted into the void.

You played riiiiiiiiight into our hands- did you really thing this job fell out of the sky for you? No, this is a gift…. for US. You gathered them all together in once place, just like he asked you to. All of those little souls, in one place, just for us. A gift. Now we can do what we were created to do. And be complete.I will make you proud, D A D D Y. Watch, listen, and be fULL.
Mike is staring that the overgrown baby.
Loud beep-

Scrappy has impaled CC with his weird spike thingy.
Mike has shot Scrappy in the head.
Susie=war things
“You are not here to receive a gift. Nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although you have, indeed, been called.”
CC has removed the arm.
Susie now is happi for William understands the pain now- 
“You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds-” *battle sounds intensify* “and smells. Misdirection, and misfortune.”

I WAS gONNA YEET MYSELF FOR GOD’SAKE-”
S h u s h-
“And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be.”
“I DUN wANNA BURN DAMNIT- AFTONS DON’T MIX WITH FIRE- Well I tend to make fire but WE STILL DOn”T LIkE iT-”
It would be very ironic for you to die in a fire- The plush is making a statement there-
Hope you get stabbed in the heart, hope you get shot and expire~ Nightmare screeches from Mike’s pocket.
“I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should.” Big brain wordz.
Mike rolls his eyes. “how long is your speech-”
“Long enough to start the fire, why?”
Susie has removed a leg.
“u g h -”
hEY-
Head bonk.
“And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirit. They don't belong to you.”
Mike is waiting impatiently.
NO- YOU WILL NOT FLAMEBROIL MEEEEEEEEEE!!
Jeremy has removed his final limb.
“SHUT UP AND BURN”
Scrappy is rolling away. WHY CAN’T YOU STAY DEAD???
“W H Y  C A N T  Y O U?” Susie has commited bonk again.
“For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears.”
BECAUSE I’M INTENDED TO STAY ALIVE AS LONG AS I WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANT-
“Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.”
oH FUCK NOT UCN NO NO NO-
“YeS sUfFeR bItCh-”
“My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours.”
Lefty noises from the corner of the office-
Mike sighs. “Dad shut the fuck up.”
nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
“And then, what became of you. I should've known you wouldn't be content to disappear. Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then... so let me save you now. It's time to rest... for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.”
PrOuD lEfTy noISeS-
Mike honestly feels bad for stealing CC from Lefty-
“This ends for all of us.”
“Well except for some of us because we need to exist later for ~Dark Nights Plot Reasons~.”
“Excuse me what? aRe yOu dEfY-”
Yes- The Pile Of Wires commits exist because yes-
“Yep.”
Definitely- Oiver is being plush.
“... End Communication.”
“FINALLY-””
The murder trio are attempting to tie Scrappy to a chair- or tape him to the wall- they need to find shit to do that first-

NO VOID LEAVE THE MCDONALDS IN PEACE FUCK YOU-
I  w i l l  d o  w h a t  I  w a n t.
Scrappy has fallen into the flames. nOOOOOOOOOOO- he has rolled out of the flames and is now pinned under a piece of roof. 
The flames are closing in.
Scrappy is fear.
Henry is torn between happi and pissed- he chooses happssed.
Scrappy is attempting to make a deal with Luci to save him.
“What do you have to offer me, murder grape?”
I won’t kill your family?
“I don’t have a family. Try again.”
I’ll give you chocolate?
“CHOCOLATE?”
jUST gEt mE oUT oF hEre and YEs I’Ll GIve yoU lOTs oF chOCoLAte-

~The fabric of that universe has collapsed into itself.~
~FNaF VR (Help Wanted {Mental help?})
Mike has shmacc into wall. “oW-”

Fritz has been yeeted right back into Foxy’s stage area. “WHY-”
H e l l o   b e a n   i n s i d e   m e !
“It scares me that I’m talking to myself.”
“M e h.” When Susie has seen herself many times-
“Yeah but i’ve never done this before this is weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird-”
Yes, yes it is. Hi other me.
“Fair enough-”
“wHo aRe yOu pEoPlE?”
“We are randos scattered from around the FNaF universe.”
“... im just not gonna question what you mean by that-”
“We’ve been yeeted through all of the FNaF events. ALL of them that actually matter- the rando things fucked off so we’re still sane but it’s not been fun-”
“We’ve broken reality!” Dont question why CC is so proud of that-
“Yes, yes we have.”
The fact that i’m staring at myself proves this.
“The fact that I’m sitting on my animatronic form’s feet definitely proves this.”
Jeremy has emerged from the door- 
Oliver has yeeted himself off into the darkness. whEEEEEE *WHOOMPH*
“wtf-”
“-just-”
-happened-
Vanny is about to leave.
“YOu can’t do that-”
You’re an integral part of the game!
Mike is currently raiding the prize counter for a the tapes.
Vanny is now wondering if going into one of the minigames will free her of the chaos that is   t h i s-

They are yeeted into the tiny office. “AH IT SO CRAMP-”
Susie and Jeremy have already left the office- 
Fritz yeets on over to Pirate’s Cove.
Oliver yeets over to the kitchen to party with GF.
GF yeets him out of the kitchen.
Susie has gone into the kitchen. She has access to pans again. :>
Mike is flipping through the cameras. “Should we just ignore the gameplay entirely and just get the tapes and coins? Or just the tapes? Or do we actually play through all 56 minigames??”
Vanny is staring at Mike like he is crazy.
“Why are you staring at me like i’m insane?”
“... w h o  a r e  y o u?” 
“Michael. We don’t talk about my last name.”
CC about to ruin his career-
Mike shoots CC a warning look.
CC just has this >:3 face. “M i c h a e l  A f t o n. :>”
“Oh for fuck’s sake- Yes hi I’m Mike Afton-”
“We just got here from burning our dad!” 
“Oh shit we’re going down this rabbit hole?”
“Yes.” 
“Oh shit-”
“So, we’ve been teleported several places- Freddy’s, my brain, Circus Baby’s, another Freddy’s- that one we burnt down- and our dad was kinda an avocado animatronic. So we taped him to a wall and he got burned. :>”
“We’ve been busy.”
“. . .” Vanny has left.
Mike shrugs. “Oh well.”
“I dont think she liked the story-”
“Eh. Better this way.”
“M e h.”
Vanny has rejoined. And has finally figured out that this is a reality now- and commited Google.
“Shit.” Mike is very concerned.
Vanny has this “thisisfine” look on her face-
Mike is concerned. “Should I be scared-”
Pan noises from the kitchen intensify.
Mike shuts the doors by reflex. “Do the animatronics in this one actually attacc?”
“. . . yes?”
“Hes used to crackheads-”
“Shiiiiiiiiiiit-” Mike is now automating the doors.
“... you could try doing this like a normal person for once-”
“We all know that i’m not a normal, sane human being.”
“Are you implying something here?” Mike is sus.
“Istg if you’re referring to the who homosexual thing I will stab you-”
“... no im not-”
“OKAY GOOD-”

“...oh for god’s sake- THAT WAS MY DAD-” 
“... one moment.” Vanny has poofed again. Google intensifies.
“Shi-”
Vanny has come back. “Well that was an unfortunate Google result-”
“No kidding.”
“So you were…” *memory failure* “... attacked by a spoon made for… idiots?”
“As Pankek says it, yes.”
W A L L.
“Who is Pankek?”
“One of the beans behind our current existence.”
“... yall have imaginary friends still?”
“No.”
YES-
“SHUDDUP-”
The plush demon commits speak. It’s Mike’s imaginary friend. :>
“I regret bringing you along-” Mike has taken the plush demon from his pocket and has yeeted the thing onto his head. “S T A Y.”
The plush has absolutely no idea what to do or say-
“And yes I am being nice to you- don’t make me regret it- I actually want to like you- but-”
The plush has decided to shut off it’s living abilities temporarily. This is a fancy way of saying hes gonna take a nap. 
Mike shrugs and puts the bean into his jacket pocket wiff the head poking out (so just the bean’s body is in the pocket.) It should be rather comfortable in there. Have a good nap-
Vanny is confused! Vanny has walked into a wall in confusion!
“Are you gud?”
“nO-”
Susie and Chica are having a frying pan party in the kitchen.
“Why?”
“tHe pLuSh sPoke? AnD wHy mUsT tHe cHilD bE sMacC-”
“It’s a demon. And because the child is insane.”
“... I-”
*youbeatthenightsounds*
Mike asks again, “Are we playing through all of the game or are we going to just hack and get the tapes?”

“Know what?”
Insert screechy child noises from above Mike and Vanneh-

“Imma just hack the game- gimme a sec-” The game world is now glitching intensely.
Screechy Jeremy noises-
The world is now gliching and skewing. “sORRY sORRy-” world is breaking apart. Momentarily. The world has restabilized. “Okay, all the nights should be unlocked now.”
Susie and CC are staring at the door. Jeremy has calm- but still-
“What the actual fuck is that thing-”
Fritz is staring at the glitchbean.
It’s a string bean!
Mike appears out of nowhere. ‘HoLY shIT scREEECHH-” Mike is about 6 inches from the ‘string bean’.
*Wave and try to grab Mike*
Mike yeets away from the string bean.
Vanny mock waves back.
Mike has yeeted back to the table. They have 2/16 tapes. Mike realizes they didn’t get the tape in FNaF 1. B O O P.
Y e e t.
Mike grabs the tape and yeets the group back into the main menu thingy. They get yeeted into the wall.
Vanny is about to throw up-
Mike honestly doesn’t care. “WhErE’S thE neXt tApE-”
“nOw hOw iN tHe heLL dO i kNoW?”
“idfk-”
The children are considering attacking the glitch.
Fritz takes initiative and yeets himself at the bean.

Pankek: Early and severely late disclaimer- we dont follow canon shit too well- if ya gonna screech, there is the email and the void. :>
Kytten: Yeahhhhhhh-
Unusual portal opens off in the corner. Screaming children noises.
Mike staring at the portal. “Who are we getting yeeted at us this time?”

“I was going to throw you into this random universe and get rid of you. That’s not gonna happen now though, is it-”
“NopE!”
“Mable calm down.”
‘Mable’ is yeeting glitter at the dorito.
“What the fuck is happening-” Mike is super confused.
CC isnt even surprised anymore. “The dorito sent children to the right universe to get rid of them- he just got brought with them-”
“I AM NOT A DORITO-” Dorito is glowing red. Eye is locked on CC.
“CC- don’t anger the dorito-”
“I AM NOT A DORITO-”
“He’s a dorito demon.”
“Yeah! Dorito demon!”
“More childz? chIldRENhAI-” Fritz has yeeted over. Oh look they’re the same age- and height.
“... are we not good enough for you?”
Fritz pauses for a second. “What can I say to get in the least amount of trouble?”
“dIPpER omG THEY hAve RoBoT aNimAlS-”
‘Dipper’ is staring at Foxy. “this isn’t going to end well.”
Mable has yeeted over to Foxy. “HAi haI I wiLL mAke yoU pREtTY-” glitter attack.

Foxy is making weird noises.
“Why did I get cursed to deal with this. HeY mIKE coME hERE!”
Mike is staring at the dorito. “I never told you my name?”
“He’s a mind-reading demonic dorito.” Dipper glances at the dorito.
The demon plush has woken up. aNoThEr dEmOn?
“A flammable object? Don’t mind if I do-” Flame has been yeeted at the flammable object.
“BILL NO-” Dipper has yeeted out of the way of the flame. Cue him patting out mini flames on his vest.
The flammable object has poofed away.
New challengers have appeared: Nightmare, Luci.
Luci yeets himself onto Mike’s shoulder. “New dorito dude. Hi.”
“I AM NOT A DORITO.”
The plush is in a secure spot commiting summon demon bears.
Alastor has briefly appeared to yeet the plush into the group. “Nn seance for yoy.”
Alastor has dissapeared.
The dorito is staring at the spot Alastor has appeared in. “What the hell is wrong with this universe. Children let’s go these people are more insane than the tiny creeper. Bill is attempting yeet children.
Dipper is kinda just floating in the air surrounded by the typical blue shimmery effect that happens whenever Bill is doing…. Billshit. “Here we go again-”
War children have attacked the dorito
“D O N T   L E A V E E E E E E E E E E E E”
Dorito kinda just laughs as the children yeet right through him. “I don’t exist you fools! Well I do but- just ask Dipper he’ll explain it-”
“I will not explain it.”
“OOOO I like it here Dipper can we stayyyy?”
“Sure.”
Mable is squealing happily.
Happeh children noises.
String Bean has yeeted himself into the room. “Oh new bean. Hi dorito.”
Bill is silently flashing red.
Dipper slowly backs away from the dorito. “Maybe angering the dorito isn’t the best idea??”
“I AM NOT A DORITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-” Dipper has been yeeted through the roof.
Dipper shrieking noises.
Bill is staring at the hole in the roof with a look of, ‘what-’.
The children have commited stack and yeet. Jeremy has been yeeted through the hole in the roof.
Dipper is chilling. He’s embedded in one of the rafters in the roof. “Hi. I’m fine.” Hat falls off. “nO COME BACK My CHILD-” hat has been grabbed.
“Hey Mike come here.”
Mike slowly approaches the dorito.
“If you agree to not call me a dorito, I will unplushify your bf. I just need a puppet.”
Dipper is screeching something from the ceiling but it’s unintelligible.
Mike is considering this offer. “Why do you need a puppet…?”
“To be able to interact with the world, d u h.” Dorito holds out arm. Is glowing blue.
Mike is considering this offer.
Mike you dont make deals with demons- Plush is giving the idiot a warning-
T O O L A T E !

*commence Dorito stealing Mike’s body-*
Mike yeets himself at his body. Passes right through.
“Well shit.”
“Mike you are an idiot-”
Did I or did I not just say you dont make deals with demons-
Dorito Mike walks into a wall. “I forgot how hard it is to use bodies.”
“Dude you stole my body not even two months ago.” Dipper glares at Dorito Mike.
Dorito Mike shrugs. “Shush.”
Oliver is just staring at this. Dude why did you shake the dorito’s hand??
Yeet into Foxy. “BECAUSE I’M AN IDIOT-”
HEY GET OUT OF MY BODY-

Especially stranger demons- demons in general, but why in the actual fuck would you trust the dorito demon-
“I don’t know.”
“I AM NOT A DORITO!” axe has been yeeted at everyone.
Dipper has yeeted himself at Mable and knocked them under the table. “Avoid the axes.”
Vanny has yeeted them into FNaF 2-
Cypher yeets after them. Firewall has detected him as a virus. He has been yeeted. “FIRST A DORITO AND Now A VIRUS?” most of the game is now on fire.
The void has consumed the fire.
Dipper notices that his vest has dissapeared. “Why does this always happen.”
Mable is asleep in the vent.
“mABLE-” Dipper has dragged the bean out of the vent.
Mike is currently attempting to install doors.
Dipper has decided to help. “You plugged that in backwards.”
“What.”
“You plugged the data cable in backwards.”
“Oh.” Mike has fixed.
“Wrong cable.”
“Oops.” Fix.
“There ya go.”
“Imagine that- you have been doing shit wrong- that explains the fires and explosions-”
“ShUSH-”
Dipper is unconcerned.
Susie is obviously a genius. The has walked into the giant hole in the wall. Off to find Freddy and boop the snoot.
Dipper just watches the child leave. “Is that safe?”
“No.”
“Then why-”
“Boop the snoot.”
“...What?”
“It’s a popular thing to boop Freddy’s nose.”
“...Why?”
“it squeaks.”
“Okay then.” Dipper has yeeted into the darkness.
Mike facepalms.
CC and Jeremy follow the children.
Mike yeets after the beans.
Mable runs after the other children.
The dorito is yeeting after them.
The Freddy’s are being bullied. Boopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboopboop.
Dipper is staring at Mangle. “That is, awful, engineering.”
Freddy has bitten the children.
“Mangle was kinda torn apart by children- oh great Susie and CC are bleeding-” 
“DAMMIT- dAmMiT-”
“Who put it back together?”
Mike is currently punching the shit out of Freddy.
Freddy is saying “ow ow ow ow ow ow” over and over again.
Dipper is staring at this. “Is- this normal?”
Fritz pops into existence next to Dipper.
Dipper skitters backwards in surprise with a shriek.
“Pretty normal.” 
“This is weird, even for Gravity Falls standards.” Dorito is floating above the chaos. “Like seriously I think you all need mental help.”
“Like CC said. This is the right place to have people go missing. :>”
Susie is attempting to remove an arm from Toy Freddy-
“Is that a good idea?” Voice crack intensifies. Dipper immediately flinches. Not this again-
Mable is remembering the voice crack techno remix tape.
Fritz kinda just stares at the bean. “Dude ya gud?” He’s obviously somehow still innocent.
Susie has removed an arm.
Toy Freddy immediately yeets Susie through the wall.
Dipper decides that it was, in fact, not a good idea. “That was definitely not a good idea.”
“I wonder if i can possess animatronics?” Dorito has yeeted into Toy Freddy.
Susie is pain. But she does not regret.
Dipper is looking at Susie like she’s insane.
She is insane.
Dipper has commit self-yeet. “OUT ME MIND DEMON!”
Now Jeremy is looking at Dipper like he is insane.
Dipper stares back at Jeremy. “What.”
Mable is currently sitting on Bonnie’s head.
“Which demon was it?” Jeremy trying to not push Mable off.
“The weird staticy one.”
“Oh. The other demon plush.”
Dipper nods. “That one.”
Bill is currently busy trying to figure out how to move robot limbs.
CC is now booping Toy Freddy’s snoot.
Toy Freddy has consumed the child’s hand.
“Well shit-” 
“Your fault for booping me, kid.” Arm is jankily movimg. “MOVE DAMN YOU MOOOOOOOOOVE- Pinetree give me a hand-”
CC is slowly trying to pull his hand out-
Dipper shrugs. “You got yourself into this situation. I’m not helping you out of it.”
“PINETREEEEEE-”

Cypher is attempting to bite again
CC has yeeted himself out of the way.

CC has smol panik.
“You have a gummy bear in your hand. Lemme take that rq-” Bill is reaching for the gummy bear. Grab the gummy bear. Quickly grab the bean’s hand and quickly say little incantation. Yeet into the bean. YEET OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WITH FLOATY SPIDER BODY.
Dipper is just staring at the spider boi. “Did he just-”
CC just staring. “I do belive he just did.”
Mike jumps. “hOLY shIT yOU doN’t hAVe A bOdY buT i cAN STilL See YoU?”
“I think all of us can.” Dipper waves his hand through the bean. “Definitely not in a body.”
CC is debating being a floaty thing or yeeting into one of the animatronics. He chooses floaty thing.
“It is rather fun to be out of your body. At first, anyway.”
“I still think sock-you was adorableeeee-” Mable noises.
“... I would ask for a story- but I have a feeling I dont want.”
“He stole my body and to get help I had to possess a sock puppet.” Dipper shrugs.
“So possession seems to be nothing new for you.”
“Definitely not.” Dipper stares at the CC body floating around the ceiling.
“Now someone please explain the gummy bear-”
“Probably was his way of tricking you into letting him grab your hand.” Dipper dodges out of the way of a yeeting possessed CC body.
“Thats a new one- oh it seems he learned how to yeet.”
“This could get dangerous.” Dipper is completely serious.
“Just wait for a certain child to notice. And stop booping the poor Toy Bonnie-”
*Boop*
Toy Bonnie has given up trying.
Toy Freddy has yeeted himself at Cassidy. “STAHP POKIN MAH BEANZ-”
Gabriel has yeeted onto TF and is now booping intensely.
Dipper sits down.

“But why are you so s-”
Another sock has been yeeted.
Dont mind the child. Shes getting ready to play baseball.
Cypher has yeeted into one of the nights. They have no idea which one.
“Did he just kidnap my body??” Dipper is floating bean. Note the missing hat and vest. And the missing shoes.
Susie is now disappointed- she didnt get to attacc a possessed bean.
CC has reclaimed his spider body-
Mike is currently trying to find where Cypher went.
Dipper would like to help but he’s currently a ghost.
Vanny just staring from the corner of the room. “. . . This is gonna be ridiculous-”
“Probably.” Dipper ghost noises.
“Go yeet yourself at an animatronic if you want-”
Dipper has yeeted himself into Mike on accident.
“GREAT NOW WE SHARE A BODY-” Mike noises.
“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-” Dipper noises.
Flailing limbs and fighting voices noises. Mike’s body is kinda just spasming around randomly.
“Huh. This looks familiar.”
“It does?” Mike.
“It does?” Dipper.
“It does?” Mable. “Cool!”
“NOT COOL-” Mike and Dipper noises. Twitchy body. 
“THIS SUCKS-” Mike hiss.
Dipper is kinda just rolling with the punches now. Mike is in control.
Mike yeets himself into a wall. “I CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS HELP-”
“I like it no better than you do.” Shudder.
“Eh. They’ll work it out-”
Mike and Dipper are having a mental conversation.
Dipper is slowly losing his sanity.
Mike doesn’t like having a kid in his mind. Don’t think about Oliver don’t think about Oliver don’t think about Oliver shit stop thinking about Oliver shit that didn’t work.
Dipper is making weird noises.
Mike is kinda just dying.
“Or they can be knocked out, if that’s easier.”
“HELP-” Mike noises.
Dipper is being silent. Dipper is also yeeting Mike’s body against the wall over and over again, trying to knock them out.
Susie has hit them in the back of the head with le hammer.
Mike has passed out.
Dipper is in control now. “That….worked?”

Children and demon plush have formed a circle. 
“D O R I T O”
D O R I T O
Dipper’s body yeets out from P&S and yeets into another level.

Dipper is flipping around randomly.
“We arent finished yet. D O R I T O”
D O R I T O
D O R I T O
“D O R I T O”
Continue to shout dorito.
The children are all hovering in the air surrounded by blue shimmery thingy. They are yeeted into a wall, then another wall. They are continuing to get yeeted into walls.
Vanny is concern. “At least they got a reaction- thats better than what me and my friends have gotten in the past-”
Dipper is yeeting around randomly. “aEAEAeAeAeeeAEeAe?”
You beat the night noises.
Everyone being yeeted noises.
Dorito yeets into the DLC.
Demon Plush feels an invader in his home.
GET OUTTA THE DLC BITCH- THATS MY PLACE- NOTURS-
Dorito is not responding, other than the flammable object catching fire.
The void inhales fire. No fire in the VR game.
Okey he is in the DLC guys- if that helps-
Dipper immediately yeets into the DLC.
Children follow.
Mike kinda just wakes up and is happy he is not sharing a body. Yeet into the void.
The void spits him into the DLC.

The void has inhaled a child. Child has been yeeted at the Demon Pringle. *Smacc*
Mike has been yeeted.
Dorito yeets himself into a wall. “OW.” Yeet.

Cypher is greatly concerned.
Vanny has arrived with a demon dorito vacuum. 
Bill has yeeted higher.
“I have the power!”
Bill yeets even higher.
The void disagrees with Bill. The Demon Prongle has been yeeted back down.
Vanny has imprisoned the demon dorito that cant go 5 minutes without trying to possess something.
“Go possess a sock.”
“I can’t. You trapped me.” sarcastic pringle noise. Bill slowly floats through the prison bars.
“Better for everyone.” *turns the vacuum back on*
Bill possesses the vacuum.
Vanny shrugs and sets it down in the garbage.
Bill yeets out.
Vanny snatches it out of the air, puts it back in the garbage, flips the garbage over, and sits on the garbage.
Bill has disappeared. YOU CANNOT STOP ME!
“... well shit he gave the vacuum superpowers- excuse me I need to grab my chainsaw-”
Vanny has left again.
Bill is gone.
Vanny has returned with her chainsaw. “Where is the vacuumified dorito-”
“He left.
“Aw shit.”
Dipper is currently reading stuff from ~the journal~.
Mable is attempting to brush her hair.
“At least it was dorito specific. He wont be able to do too much harm-”
Dorito yeets into a wall.
Dipper looks up for a second, shrugs, and goes back to reading.
Mable has discovered that candy exists in this universe and is raiding prize counter.
Mike is staring at Mable. “Is- she okay?”
“No.” Dipper doesn’t even look up from ~book~.
“Its a very interesting reaction to candy-” CC is much concern.
Nightmare’s plooshie has been possessed by Bill. ~Nobody n o t i c e~.
Dipper has flopped down.
Vanny has gotten rid of the vacuum.
Vacuum has self-yeeted at Vanny.
Dipper has commit press self into floor.
Vacuum has sailed over him.
Vanny is prepared to attacc.
Vacuum has yeeted itself into Vanny’s face.

Le slicing of the vacuum.
Vacuum explodes.
Panik self-yeeting. Vanny has left.
Bill yeets himself out the the plooshie. “That was some great entertainment.”
Vanny has returned with holy water.
Bill is staring at Vanny. “You seriously think that you can- *LAUGHING* vanquish me with, THAT?”
“Not for you idiot- for the coming storm. Also, I brought ice water as well- because that is just as effective.”
Dipper sits up. “What storm?”
“KOLKOLATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-” Mable appears to be high.
“No explanation needed.” Vanny has walked towards the Glitchbitch. “tImE tO tEsT iF yOu aRe sOlId!”
I’s timE to die. GlitchBitch is staring at Vanny.
*Sploosh*
The ice water is returned to Vanny’s face.
“diP DOp DiP dOp dIp dOP-”
Dipper is attempting to ignore Mable.
Mable is insisting.
Dipper has failed his roll. Lose a turn. You are at your sister’s mercy, bean.
Dipper has been glitterified.
Dipper is trying to not breathe in sparkles. Commence coughing. “mAblE-”
Vanny notes that Glitch committed unoreversecard-
Mike is trying to not laugh. Dipper is a fucking disco ball-
Dipper is attempting to hide.
Vanny has left and returned with her own lil mirror. “lOoK aT uR wEaSeL fAcE-” 
Weasel is attempting to ignore the mirror.
Dipper is attmepting to escape from Mable’s ~kit of makeup~.
“diP DoP TiCk TOCk-” Bill noises. “Let’s see how you look with some mascara on!”
Dipper has been immobilized. Cue Dipper screeching.
Mable has equipped ~makeup attack~.
Dipper screeching noises.
Susie doesnt know whether to save the screeching child or join in with the attack.
Dipper is begging for help.
Join the army. I’ll get more makeup. Nightmare yeets through a portal.
Susie is having a crisis. 
All the demons ~Kytten demons, that is~ are encouraging Susie to help make the bean pure glitter.
Jeremy is encouraging the opposite. And silently begging CC to help. CC does nothing. W a t c h  t h e m   s u f f e r.
Dipper is having a mental breakdown.
Mable has grabbed Dipper. Run away!
Dorito yeets Dipper back into the chaos. “N O   E S C A P E.”
“If he’s a dorito, why isnt he edible-” 
“I’M NOT A DORITO.”
“Thank you for selecting… eXoTiC bUtTeRs.” CC is about to play the remix- sorry not sorry fuckers-
Dipper is attempting to free himself.
Mable has applied enough glitter glue to his eyelashes that they’re just a solid block of glitter.
Remix is playing.
Susie has picked a side. Time to free the poor child.
Dipper is greaty happy that he is being rescued. “S A V E m E -”
“nO-” Mable is continuing to apply glitter and other things.
Dorito is watching the chaos.
Susie is attempting to separate the twins. 
With the help of Fritz and Susie, Dipper has yeeted himself to freedom.
Mable signs. “yOU LooK sO pReTtY-”
Dipper immediately hides his face. No.
Vanny has committed sploosh with le water.
Dipper is grateful.
Mike is currently hacking the game again. He’s attempting to steal the tapes.
Dipper is trying to get the rest of the shit off of his face. He is failing.
“P i z z a  P a r t y?” CC casually staring at the screen.
Mike, Dipper, Mabel, flammable object 2.0, and Dorito all screech, “NO PLEASE.”
“The dorito says no- Yes it is-” *Boop*
Dipper sighs as they are yeetus. “Are we gonna die?”
“Yes.” - Bill.
“No.” - Mike.
Definitely. - Nightmare.
Dipper is concerned. “This isn’t going to go well.”
“I have made an ✨error✨”
“yEs- yEs yOu dId-” Vanny is not ready- 
“Why have you done this.” Mike is attempting to open the right-side door.
Dipper has a feeling that would be a very bad idea.
“A springobnni- sprigybons-” Susie has been attacked by water.
Mike has opened the danger door.
“YOU IDIOT-” You will never know who says this.
They have all been reset back to the bed. “WtF-”
“Whoa that’s disorienting-” Dipper is stumbling around the room.
“... I have no words- to describe how stupid that was-”
“Why not look at the Springbon-” 
“Sorry-” Mike kinda just- goes to the back of the group.
Vanny will be a good hoom- unlike CC- who is currently debating having the void send him to another dimension- “Well- it isnt the end of the world- and we know what door to take now-”
“Yep!” Mike is acting like this was planned.
Dipper wanders through the other door.
“G r e a t- this is a maze-” CC is currently noting the fact that there are more doors- “Why did I make us do this- w h y-”
Dipper is currently spinning around trying to figure out where they are and what door to go through.
“What would happen if we split up?”
Mike is consulting the death code. “I think if any of us get jumpscared we all get yeeted back to the start.”
“But we can look around faster- and know where to avoid-”
“Good point.” Dipper is mentally splitting the group into 3 grou;s. “Okay so. We can split into three groups. Two groups of 4 and one of 5. Pair up everyone!”
Dipper, Bill, Mable, and Fritz are in one team.
CC, Susie, Jeremy, and Vanny have yeeted into a team.
Which means that Nightmare, Oliver, Mike, Gabriel, and Flammable Object are in a team.
Dipper is being big brain. “So one team takes one door and the other two take one.”
The children have yeeted at the cake room. Vanny has followed the crazy children.
The other two groups yeet into Plushtrap Hall.
Demon plush has decided sleeping through this is smart.
Mike carefully puts the ploosh into his pocket.
“Chocolate?” -CC
“Chocolate.” -Vanny
“Yes.” -Susie
“That door?”
“Yes.”
“gO-”
Dipper’s group yeets into Funtime Auditorium. 
Mike’s team have decided to yeet into one of the doors. Hello jumpscare!
~Everyone gets yeeted back~.
“Which door?” 
“What?” Mike is confused.
“Door G in Plushtrap Hall, the Second Door one the left when looking down at the hall from where springy is.” Dipper shrugs. “I pay attention to these things.”
“Big brain moments.”
“Yes- big brain moments-
Mike is staring at Dipper. Now Mike feels like an idiot.
Dipper ignores Mike. Yeet through the door wth his group.
Mike shrugs and takes his group through to Plushtrap hall.
Dipper’s group has gone to Funtime Auditorium.
The children and Vanny have yeeted at the chocolate door.
Dipper’s group has gone into Ennard’s room. They yeet through Door K and into the Kitchen.
Mike’s group has yeeted into the FNaF 3 Hall via door H,
“Okay where now?”
“W e l l- there are 2 options-”
“Go right?”
“G o  r i g h t.” 
Dipper’s group has yeeted through door L. Cue jumpscare.
~They are yeeted.~
“Door L in Ennard’s room, first door on the left.”
“Alri- WAIT UP-”
The children have left Vanny behind.
“Fu-”
Vanny has run after the children.
Dipper’s group have made it back to Ennad’s room.
Mike’s group are taking a break.
Dipper is now placing “DANGER!” sticky notes on danger doors.
“Now we go right.”
The group of children and Vanny have yeeted through the door. Welcome back to that one FNaF hall- wait thats backwards- Welcome back to that FNaF 1 hall-
“. . . well this is defying logic more than we do-”
“Ya sure about that?”
“... no-”
Dipper has tripped over a random cord and is now buried in dust.
“Right?”
“Yep.”
They go to the plushtrap hall.
Fritz is unburying Dipper.
Dipper is grateful.
“Straight ahead is another door- to our left there are doors- to our right, there are doors- why are there so many doors?”
Mable has yeeted herself through a random door.
Dipper screeches. “MABLE NO-” tOO LATE! Mable is gone. Mable has yeeted through door D.
Dipper’s group yeets after Mable. They are back in Plushtrappies beanroom.
“Random door?” -Susie
“Why not-” -Jeremy
“Which one-” -Susie
CC has his ways- YEET-
CC has smacced a wall.
“oW-”
“Gotta stop attacking the wall-”
Mike’s group has decided to take a nap.
Dipper’s group has gotten Mable. They immediately yeet back into Ennard’s room.
CC has yeeted ahead. Susie, Jeremy, and Vanny follow- they have arrived in the FNaF 3 office area-
“Oh great we are back where we started.”
“Lets try again.”
Yeet into the plushtrap hell.
Yeet into the FNaF 3 hall.
“hEy a dIfFeReNt rOoM!”
Dipper’s group is sitting down to take a break for a second.
CC’s group has found their way back to the bedroom.
“... did we die?”
“No, nobody else is here-”
“hOw dId wE eNd uP bAcK hErE?”
“hOw dO i kNoW?”
Dipper’s group is committing yeetus. Through Door I and then through door E. Then through random door. Into the bedroom. Yay 2 of 3 groups are together now.
“How did we get back here??” Dipper noises.
“If we knew, we’d tell you-” Jeremy noises.
“How late do we have to be- to be considered late?”
“No fucking clue- this thing is very tolerant it seems-”
Susie has left them behind. 
Catching up group noises.
Dipper’s group has made it back to Ennard’s room.
The dumbass children and Vanny have found the Funtime Auditorium. Flash noises.
Mike’s group are currently buried in dust.
Dipper’s group have managed to yeet themselves into Plushtrap Hall. They take a break.
The children took too long to choose a door. G a m e  r e s e t  s h i t,  f o r  F u n f o x b i t c h  h a s  y e e t e d  t h e m.
Dipper has flopped over. “We’re never going to escape.” exasperated child noises.
“N o  w e  a r e  n ot-”
“We’re going to die in here.” Dipper is now starting to depress himself.
“Maybe you are-” And now Jeremy has followed the group.
The child has been shot a warning look from Mable. “You’ll be fine, Dipper.”
Dipper points out the fact that they’ve got a springboi crawling towards them.
The child group have found the Poopet room.
Bill is currently attempting to twist reality further and make the maze make even less sense. So far he’s just making doors that lead to nowhere.
The void decides this is useful and has yeeted those doors into the doors that lead to death!
Bill is now working with the void to turn this into a hellhole.
The children have found the kitchen. How? Vanny cheated. She has the power of Google on her side. :>
Dipper’s group have found their way to Mangle’s room. C H O C O L A T E   O R   V A N I L LA ?
The children have picked pepperoni. They have arrived in the Poopet room again.
“wHy?”
“You already know we dont know how to answer that question.”
“Lets go right.”
Mike’s group have found their way into the kitchen. They have selected cheese. They yeet through door A.
Vanny just casually leading the group through the maze. “Now look up?” *up* “oH hEy-”
The group has climbed to where they need to be. 
Dipper’s group are yeeting around rapidly. The FFPF Wiki is very helpful. Dipper is kinda just navigating them around the place, but they’re being careful because of the doom doors. They are now in the office but they are buried in dust.
Mike’s group is about to be jumpscared for taking too long.
“There’s the glitchrat! … oh hell no not doing that again-” Susie is not that stoopid. She will not follow a random yellowish bunny again-
Dipper’s group have made it to the vent. Look up. YEET-
Mike’s group is stranded in Ennard’s room. *JUMPSCARESIMMINENT !*
“So we not following the weasel?”
“C o r r e c t.”
Dipper’s group has yeeted up into the area. “H I  W E “ R E   A L I V E !”
Mike’s group has been jumpscared.
“Hi. Dont follow the weasel. It never goes well.”
“I wasn’t planning on it.”
“G o o d.”
The children have learned their lesson the hard way-
Dipper is eating his group’s cake. Nobody else wanted it. He has stopped at 3 slices.
“I wonder where the others are-”
“I have no idea.”
“How much longer until they are late?”
“Not much longer!"
Susie has proceeded to consume the chocolate cake. “Cograats to dem-” 
Dipper, Mable, and Fritz are all happily eating their pizza. Yes, the pizzas are extra-large because all of the children.
So many children.
M a n y   c h i l d s.
Bill is attempting to eat the pizza but is failing.
“So do we wait for them, or..”
“They’re taking too long.” Dipper is looking down the vent. Nobody.
“I wonder if they got jumpscared.”
“I sure hope not- that will take much longer-”
“Yeah. Should we just… continue without them or will the game not let us have both a minigame and the main menu loaded at the same time…?” Dipper is now sitting.
“It probably will kick them.”
“Areyousureaboutthat-”
“ShutupJeremy-”
Mike’s group are not having any luck.
Dipper has yeeted through the curtains.
Dipper’s group follows.
“... can we just stay here?”
“No Jeremy- we cant- unless you want to wait-”
“We literally are going to abandon our pizza-”
“... pizza first- then we go-”
Consume the pizza.
Rapid pizza consumption has been terminated due to low system performance. Please exit the party at once to reduce system resource consumption.
“... bummer. Let’s go. Not like you’re going to die again.”
Yeeting children and Vanny.
Fritz has fallen off of the stage. “oW-”
Dipper commit help the bean ack up to the stage.
A w k w a r d  s i l e n c e
Dipper has noticed the weasel. “Are we dead?”
Fritz is brushing himself off.
“You arent.”
“Whut that mean?” Dipper is confuzzle.
Fritz notices that his private little stage has had its curtain torn down. He is much anger.
“You seem to be forgetting you are with a bunch of dead kids.”
“You don’t look dead. But yes I forgot.”
Bill is currently attempting to get the weasel to shake his hand.
CC decides to commit Glitchbitch dance.
Mike’s group has gotten jumpscared. To conserve system resources (since what the larger group of children are doing is more important) Mike’s group is currently trapped in the bedroom (the doors are locked and the rest of the level is unloaded. The textures in the bedroom are also now at 3% of their normal quality. Very pixley mess).
Susie has given up reading the credits and walked off the stage.
The game has automatically sent all the children that aren’t in-minigame back to the level select. DLC is now unlocked.
“Where’s Mike’s group?” Bill is not in the least interested.
Dipper is currently attempting to press the DLC button. Pressed. Dipper is exploring the menu. He has discovered the Pirate shit. He is attempting to decide which one to press.
Fritz has booped the Corn Maze.
Gabriel has screeched.
The children, minus Mike’s group, are now standing in the middle of the dark spoopy maze. They have to get all 5 keys and get to the middle of the maze and oot the hatch.
“tHE hECC??” Bill has yeeted himself up, hits a barrier keeping them from peeking over the walls of the maze, and has been yeete back down. “oW-”
“... hol up- I CANT BE SPIBBER?!”
“Apparently not.” Dipper is attempting to shove his way through one of the corn wall things. He is failing.
Fritz is looking around one of the corners. “Uh- guys, I hate to tell you this but- my animatronic self is coming straight towards us, but he hasn’t seen us yet…. he’s around one of the corners… we need to run NOW oH SHIT HE JUst CAME AROUND THE CorNEr-” Fritz has yeeted himself back around the corner. “We are in trouble.”
“So we get to be in another endless hell!”
“Yes and RUN-” Fritz has taken off down the lil path.
Dipper, Mable, and Gabriel run after.
Children and Vanny yeet as fast as they fuckin can-
FoxFox has yeeted himself around the corner. He hath caught the smell of child. YEETUS-
Fritz has yeeted himself behind a cardboard cutout.
Dipper’s group aka the Kytten beans have yeeted themselves behind the cutout. It’s getting cramped fast. They deicde to continue yeeting. “wE cAN’T All fiT bEhiND oNE of ThOSe ThINGS-”
Susie is debating attempting to break a hole in the wall.
Fritz has decided to attempt help. “lEmME helP-” Fritz has realized he’s not sufficiently strong. “nevER miND lEmME SEe iF I cAN mAKE mySElF fuCK oFF-” Fritz has yeeted himself at himself.
Susie has yeeted the kneecap hammer. 
Fritz has successfully yeeted himself onto himself.
FoxFox is confused. Creaking noises as Fritz is yeeted into a wall next to Susie with a loud thunk. Fritz is currently unconscious.
“... im not carrying the idiot-”
Dipper has picked up the child. He is struggling immensely. “chILD-” Run Boy Run is now playing in the background. 
“oH SHIT hE’s RIGHT THERE-” Gabriel pannic.
Susie has made a hole in the wall. Children commit yeet.
Gabriel has yeeted himself through the hole.
Dipper has yeeted through hole, Fritz still on back.
Vanny yeet-
Mike’s group is lagging extremely badly.
Void says fuckit and yeets Mike’s group into the Corn Maze.
The game has revoked Void’s permission to do that and has yeeted Mike’s group back to where they were. They have to get out by themselves since Mike can’t seem to get it through his skull that waiting around is a really bad idea.
Void is tempted to just rip the game apart, but decides thats a bad.
Other Void agrees. Bad idea to tear it apart while they’re inside, kid-
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh- *casually refusing to comment on the “kid” part*
Fritz is beginning to wake up. He is confused as to why he’s being yeeted and why he’s not yeeting himself around.
Dipper is beginning to lose his energy from yeeting AND carrying a bean on his back.
Vanny has snatched the child.
Fritz makes a weak protest sound.
FoxFox has yeeted Vanneh Into a wall.
Fritz has been yeetus into another wall. Unconscious gurgle.
Dipper and Gabriel has grabbed Vannh together, yeeted Fritz on top of Vanneh so they can carry both, and yeet off.
FoxFox is close behind.
CC has spibbered up the watertower thinggy, and is trying to show the other children how to spibber.
Jeremy has become spibber.
Susie is panik.
Bill, for once, decides to be helpful. All the childs on the ground are being levitated by a very tired Bill. Up up up up up up up-
“T h o i n k.” Susie has yeeted at the tower.
Bill has poofed. The other children yeet onto the water tower.
FoxFox has equipped chainsaw. bzZZzZzzZZzZZZ-
“WTF- WHY DOES FOXY HAVE A FUCKING CHAINSAW-”
Fritz has rolled onto his stomach. “probablybecauseIlikehavingalotofweapons-” he is slurring his words because ~slepp child~.
“... is attacking a good idea now?”
“nooooooo-” Fritz is staring down at the animo.
“It is literally going to kill us either way-”
Fritz shrugs and drops down towards the animo bean.
FoxFox has stabbethed Fritz through wiff the chainsaw.
Fritz is ded. Player 6 waiting to spawn~
Now the other children are angy.
CC has plann. Whispering intensifies. Nodding from other beans intensifies.
Gabriel, Dipper, and Mable are ready to provide weapons.
CC strongly wishes that wingz were a thing- or that Bill could appear- that would be helpful for this-
Ghost Fritz is kinda just- floating around waiting for the game to let him respawn.
Gabriel has yeetus himself onto FoxFox. Tightly hold the bean’s necc. “n o   e s c a p e ™” 
FoxFox kinda just squishes Gabriel against the tower and goes back to chainsawing the leg. Glitchy Bunny noises ™”
Its raining children. From out of the sky. Children. Please dont ask why.
The children have landed behind the ChainsawFoxFox.
FoxFox has managed to slice Susie’s head clean off- much blood on the FoxFox.
FoxFox has been frozen for a couple of minutes by ~void~.
Fritz is seriously considering possessing the fox.
Ghostie (Ghost Susie- so clever, I know-) just kinda shrugs. “I’ve seen and been through worse.”
Children have yeeted away.
The Void 2.0 (patents pending) is currently doing its best to keep the Fox bitch frozen. FoxFox is currently stabbing Void 2.0 to death.
FoxFox is free! He has not realized the child have escappe. Continue chainsawing the water tower!
The children have found something. They have found a red key. Congrats to them.
Water tower a bit off in the distance has collapsed!
FoxFox is yeeting off into the maze.
Fritz is beginning to become coherent. Of course he’s dead, so… “SO wE jUST… ghOST?”
“Yes.” Ghostie noises.
“Well our window just closed.”
Dipper nods. “Probably should keep moving.”
Gabriel is currently peeking around a corner. “rUN-”
Fritz is floating above the FoxFox attempting to puppet the fox. FoxFox is having arm twitches. Fritz is getting annoyed.
“wHeRE?!”
“diS wAY-” Gabriel is yeetus.
~Meanwhile~
Demon plush has woken. Poke head out of poccet.
Tf- 
Mike looks down at the ploosh. “Oh, good morning-”
Ya sure it’s morning? Looks like Glitchternoon.
Mike shrugs. “I have no idea we’ve been stuck in this room for the past hour and I don’t know why.”
Plushiver has yetus himself onto Mike’s head. Hallo floomable objecto-
Hi- why are you guys not doing anything?
Mike points at the doors in the room, all of which have a little red message floating in front of them saying “Loading Error”. “We kinda can’t.”
… imma try opening it. 
The Demon plush has self-yeeted at the door, and attempted to opemb.
Demon Plush has received a 403 Forbidden error code.
Demon Plush ignores and tries again.
Demon Plush receives an “Access Denied” message from IBoss.
More ignoring and trying again. 
Demon Plush has been locked out of everything for 2 minutes.
“Dude I told you it’s not letting us out of this room. Even Springbonnie is frozen.”
There has to be SOME way to get out-
Game briefly blinks out, then comes back.
“We’ve tried everything. There’s no way out.”
Have you asked your Dad?
Mike sighs. “N o p e.”
He don’t trust me anymore. Sad GlitchBitch sounds.
“WE ALL KNOW YOU’RE GOING TO TRY TO STEAL OUR SOULS-”
Game is on the verge of crashing. Too many system resources getting yeeted at Corn Maze.
The world around Mike’s group is dying.
The Demon plush uses his brain.
I can poof around- whut if I try poofing everyone-
Mike looks down at the ploosh. ”Are ya sure you’re gonna have enuff energy??”
iF yA dON’T i cAN hELp-
I just took the nap of the century- iLl bE fInE- but yes help is welcome-
Mike nods. “Kay-”
Plushiver is now attempting to help poof.
Access denied errors are flying around everywhere.
Demon plush has this “idgaf” vibe goin and has poofed Nightmare away.
Access denied errors are drowning the demon plush.
Nightmare yeets himself back. hEY i WAS GONNA HELP-
Nightmare you fuckin stoopid- oh look I just realized Mike is the only human here- we’re a team of plooshes-
Mike realizes this is true. “Well shit.”
Demon Ploosh has poofed Mike to the Corn Maze. And shut his eyes.
Alright yalls can take urself- bye-bye! 
Demon Ploosh has self-yeeted himself to the Corn Maze.
Room is full of access denieds.
Plushiver and Nootmare ploosh have yeeted to Corn Maze.
Gabriel and Dpper look over at the new party.
“Oh hi you appear to have finally escaped.” Fritz remembers that he ghosty and nobody can hear him but Susie. Amger  ghostie.sa
Idea.as
“I wonder if we can haunt people-”
“Hmmmmmm…” Fritz has yeted himself into Nootmare.
Fritz is possessing Nootmare! “oHmyGoDiTWORKED-” Fritz plooshie is now floating in the air. “thIS iS amAzING-”
Susie has no words.
Fritz is floating around.
Nootmare has taken his body back.
Fritz is now floating around as a ghost. “Damn You, FlamBob ™.”
“I-”
FoxFox has yeeted himself through the corn. Ignore the fact that doing that should have set the corn maze on fire.
Fritz has warned the group a second too late. “iNcOmING flAME- oh shit-”
“Not like they will hear you anyways-”
“oH rIGHT-” Fritz keeps forgetting that he impaled himself with a chainsaw. Erm, another version of him impaled him with a chainsaw.
Gabriel yeets out of the way of a ragin’ chainsaw. Now including crowbars strapped on every 3 inches!
“W H Y-” CC has chopped through a wall. Yeet.
Gabriel yeetus off down the path.
FoxFox follows the yeeting children.
Mike yeetus self up a wall and spibbers along the invis barrier.
CC has made another hole in a wall. Children are yeet.
Dipper’s group and Mike’s group yeetus through the hole. Mike spibbers down through the wall.
FoxFox yeetus through the corn. Whirring chainsaw.
“HOWTFDOWEGETRIDOFTHECHAINSAW?!”
“dO yOu rEaLlY tHiNk tHaTs fUcKiN pOsSiBlE?”
Fritz has managed to possess himself. gAH- hEllO iT mE fRiTZ- Chainsaw yeetus in a random direction away from the beans.
Panik kalms.
“aT lEaSt tHe cHaINsAw iS gOnE-”
“Minenow-”
CC has taken the chainsaw.
Fritz is busy removing all sorts of weapons from FoxFox. No weapons for demonic me-
Children and Vanny have taken the weapons. Oh look Vanny got a knife.
Fritz is now simply walking around the childs. This is surreal-
“You’re Foxy again-”
Jeremy has abandoned the group.
Fritz blonk. nooooo frienb no leaveeeee-
“LeMmE gO fInD tHe kEyYs- sO wE cAN lEaVvE-”
Fritz yeetus past Jeremy down a path. He speeb. i knoW whEre thEy ARe-
Susie is sad lonely ghostie. Time to test if the Demon Ploosh has a soul. Yeet.
Fritz yeets down a path and yeets Nootplush at Susie. Free body if DP don’t ave a soul.
Susie is confused! Susie has yeeted past the DP and yeeted through a wall!
“o W- o R  n O t-”
Now Susie is even more confused.
So is the Demon Ploosh.
Heavy animatronic wheezing. Fritz has decided to see if animatronic speakers can play music! Cue Let It Burn (by Citizen Soldier if you’re curious) blasting from FoxFox’s voice box. It’s really fucking loud but actually sounds quite good. It’s got really heavy bass too! You can tell because the corn is literally vibrating with bass.
Susie has stolen the Demon Plush’s body. Demon Plush is mad.
CC GIMME MY HAMMER-
“Okey then- I got something better-”
“... gimme-”
“MY CHAINSAW-”
“whendidyougetthechainsaw-”
Fritz has briefly lost control of FoxFox, who yeets self at the childs. Fritz manages to yeet FoxFox (and him with it-) into a rather large puddle. FoxFox is made of fire soooooooo-
Fritz is ghost again. “dAMnIT-”
“... where are we burying the body?”
We arent gonna do that- we’re gonna- wait no that might make it live again-
The game gets an idea from “live again.” FoxFox respawns a coupe of paths away.
“Aw fuck- I should have just dismantled it-”
Too late now.
“Im aware.”
Fritz yeets himself at FoxFox, who simply ghost-stabs Fritz. Fritz has completely despawned.
Player 6 has been terminated.
Fuckin hell- We just lost Fritz-
“Well we have his weapons-”
“Is that really all you care about?” Mike looks at the childs.
“It means we can kill the Fox. And then get the keys. 
And get the fuck out of here. And hopefully respawn the bean.”
“Why would that mean you can kill the Fox?”
“Kill the fox, we have time to get the keys, we get the fuck out of here, and get Fritz back. Violence isnt the answer, it’s the question. And the answer is yes.”
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
Fritz impatiently waiting in the void be like: *yAll jUSt huRry uP anD reSpaWn mE-*
“How do I answer the question-”
“Why. Is. Fritz. Being. Poofed. Make. It. To. Where. You. Can. Kill. The. Fox.”
“It doesnt? We kill the fox to bring Fritz bacc-”
Mike has switched voices to the child’s voice. “It means we can kill the Fox.” Back to Mike voice. “-_-”
“IWASREFERRINGTOTHEWEAPONSGODDAMIT-”
“oh.” Mike kinda just drops it.
Gabriel yeetus around corner. “LettUS gOooOO-”
GaBrIeL bE cArEfUl! tHerE iS a dAnGeR fOx OuT tHerE- 
Demon Plush has yoinked his body back
Stay out you little shit-
Wheezing Mike.
FoxFox has commit a Vanya. Cue blood pouring from Gabriel’s neck-
Facepalming Ghostie noises. Flying away noises.
Gabriel has become ghost. “Well shit-”
Dipper kinda- yeets away from the slashy slashy violin strings-
FoxFox attacks intensifies. Cue RPG spawn.
Dipper yeets through a corn wall.
The rest of Dipper’s group yeets away in random directions.
Mike’s group scatters.
Demon Plush was left behind. He has committed poof far away.
Nightmare has poofed Demon Plush to him and Mike. N o p e !
The Ploosh has yeeted to Mike’s head.
Mike catches the Ploosh. “No possession.”
The Demon Plush has no wordz. He just kinda has this *wut* expression on his face.
Mike gently sets the ploosh onto his head. “Under the condition of no possessing me, you can stay.”
I didnt plan on possessing you? That sounds like something that dorito would do.
“I’M nOT a fRIGgiN dORtiO-”
Mike shrugs. “Then you can stay.”
Now the Ploosh is just sitting there, lookin for the FoxFox.
FoxFox commit yeetus at ploosh.
Screechy Ploosh. Poof the squad noises.
Mike yeets out of the way a half second before he would have become a toasty crisp. Realizes they’d been poofed. “oh- hi I’m just checking how the corn is growing-” Mike stands.
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuure-
FoxFox yeetus self at some of the beans.
Yeeting away beans. CC is spibbering along the wall. 
~MURDER MURDER THE CHILDS~
CC has been stabbed by rocket spear. Spibber CC has been pinned against the wall trough the stomach and cannot move. Plus he’s bleeding out.
Pissed Ghost CC noises.
Mike is immedately aware that CC is ded. Cue him building nuke. “dIE huMANs Die dIE dIEEE-”
Ghost CC just kinda facepalmz.
Mike sets the timer to 30 seconds.
So we all die and get to restart?
“That’s the theory.” 20 seconds.
Eh. If we die we die.
CC has revoked the Demon Plush’s ability to life. And took it for himself. Hes such a kind bean.
The game has detected unauthorized CCness and has terminated the possession. Player two has been terminated.
Fritz waves at CC. “Welcome to the void-”
“Oh goodie. My favorite place.”
Mike overrides the timer.
The game gets a “oh shit” face.
World explodes.
Game crashes.
All the beans are floating in a “Attempting to recover from fatal error” screen.
Mike gets his pocket nuke. “You might want to think twice about that, kid.”
Game slowly shuts itself down.
All the beans are yeeted back into reality.
Fritz blinks. “I think I have radiation in my eyes.”
“Lemme guess. Someone broke the game.” Emphasis on the someone.
Mike shrugs. “It was starting to get annoying. Wait where are weeeee-”
Vanny in the background with this :o face.
“... CC why are we in your bedroom. What’s going on.”
Fritz is immediately nervous as he notes the four glowing eyes out one door.
“Do you think I know the answer to this question-” Yeet to door. Shut door. “But if we’re doing this again, imma be more angry than when I got stabbed.”
Nightmare and Nightmare Fredbear laughs overlap.
Mike’s eyes get big. “Wait. This isn’t a coma.” Nervous sounds. “Why is Nightmare here- and why- are we here-”
Their flashlights go out. Doors slam wide open.
“... what kind of broken reality have we just been yeeted at-”

Mike jumps back away from the animatronic right by his ear. “hOLY SHIT-”
Fritz is dragged off into the darkness. Loud child screeching.
Army of children going to try and save him noises.
All of the children are slammed against one wall. Nightmare laughs a distorted staticy laugh. Mike is poofed into a plushie. So is Fritz.
Loud poof as CC is plushified.
Oliver is already plsuh.
All of the current plushies are now stuck exactly where they are. They cannot poof away nor can they move. They are stuck in immobile bodies.
Nightmare realizes he’s staring at a non-plushie version of himself. How the fuck are there two of me-
Do you think I know?
Everyone has been plushied, except Vanny, who is mysteriously missing...
With the power of broken logic, I, Pankek, have yeeted Vanny to the dorkside- now she goes to make a bunny suit-
The plushies are gathered up at CC’s closet.
The box is sitting inside.
The box locks pop open.
Lid creaks open.
Nightmare shoves the plushies into the small cramped box.
And shuts the lid.
The locks snap shut.
All is silent... and all is dark.
Amd they can’t escape.

 *wheeze* kay so- we just leave this here and yeet them to AU and WDIMT? and do we start going back to working on AU??
XD
yea
Yeah
Me not trying to wheeze infront of Pear:
Me failing: *WHEEEEEEEZE*
Not me planning mass murder. 
Kay so quick guide on CM:
Find one of the keys (red, blue, yellow, or green) to get out of the maze via one of the gates on 4 sides of the maze (BAD ENDING)
Find 4 of the keys to unlock a special 5th key that you must find to go into the basement located in the center of the maze (GOOD ENDING)
You can hide in certain spots of the maze behind cardboard cutouts. However in the GREEN quarter of the maze, these cutouts are few and far between
JackoFoxFox will chase after you if he sees you. His chase behavior is a bit weird, if you hide before he sees you, he won’t run at you and he will respawn much faster and stay in the same area. Trigger his run and THEN hide to make him fuck off to somewhere else somewhat nearby.
I think this is the map-
“Key” XD red box is red key spawn points green is green key spawn points blue is blue key spawn points and yellow is yellow key spawn points- bl\ack is the speffle key spawn points I believe- uhhhh idk the middle is the exit I think the other two are spawn points for the players- ye i’m pretty sure that’s what it is- also the map is really big so- it takes a long time to get from one side to the other…
*wave* we’re up there-
Ye- 
up
Oh no. It seems as though you (Xander) have gotten yourself into deep shit. Unfortunately, a certain Susie has messed with the shocking system, so no shocking today. Instead, lets give you an uncontrolled yeet.
*uncontrolled yeet has been redirected*
Seriously though XD=
I’m technology grounded for the rest of the week or longer-
And to top it all off-
This week is going to be one of those weeks-
First I get tech grounded-
Then last night the light in my room shat itself and got locked on the lowest brightness setting and the color red so it was utterly useless-
AndDDDddDd I have a dentist appointment today that I didn’t know about until yesterday :)
AND my English grade is dying and i’m getting pressured to get that fixed :)
AND I have a math test on Friday-
Anywho- ya got your clases selected?
Fun fact- most of my math path is AP classes and my ENTIRE science path is AP classes :)
Like seriously this year i’m in 9th grade math and 9th grade level science- next year I go to geometry (10th math) and AP science (I don’t remember which)- i’m jumping from a 9th grade level science class to immediately a college level class :))
Op enjoy fixing that-
We can focus on the important shit- skip over obnoxious shit, get to the important shit, and then end up destroying it somehow. 
FNaF 1: blew it up.
FNaF 3: blew it up.
FNaF 4: Breadbear broke it.
FNaF 5: reality became so fucked it self destructed
FNaF 6: … burn it down, or blow it up? I chose blow it up because burning takes too long.
FNaF HW: I mean, there are several ways to break this one. It’s a game, soooo. (Probably have Mike hack it to escape the prison and they get yeeted into plushie form and ~into the box~)
^ And this proves that we have a habit breaking the shit-
Uh- so- um. We have to do 56 nights, which is ALL of the previous games plus minigames-
Yeah- we have to do it that way because of the plot- and that but that means that we get a second chance at FNaF 2-
Ye
DO NOT DELETE:
Order: 
Giver
Gathering Blue
Messenger
Son
Notes: 
Messenger before Son
Power through the feeling of “what does this have to do with The Giver”
~Plans for FNAF6 ending~
Yeet William into the flames as a sacrifice
Have CC, Oliver, and Mike escape the fire
Yeet the mind-reading Flammable Objects into the flames
[Maybe] have the beans watch the place burn down
~FNAF VR shit that needs to happen~
Arrive at the game thing
Plushify Oliver on accident and use him to find the other flammable objects
Find the flammable objects and kidnap them
Travel back in time and yeet them into the flames to keep William from remotely stabbing Mike and escaping (keep Oliver)
Beat all 56 nights (holy shit that’s gonna take foreverrrrrr-) (wait what about Vanny? sHe dOeS hAvE sOmE sOrT oF iMpOrTanCe hErE-)
Do the tape shit with Vanny and Mike and the others getting imprisoned
~The Ending~
Have the beans (not counting Vanny, for she gets to continue to suffer- dont worry about ittttt-) escape from the game into CC’s room (the real one)
Have some shit happen and the beans get plushified
Get yeeted in the FNaF 4 box
Somehow explain how all of this happened in some period of time before the actual game events take place. And they’re the things in the FNaF 4 box you see trying to escape in the cutscene in the FNaF 4 game
Publish this shit and redo FNaF 2
Yeet CC and Mike into Among Us
And then we move to Among Us or Redo FNaF 2. But it has proven to be very unrelated so maybe not- oh yeah promises- fuck- oh well- 
wE cAn dO tHiS-
*~*~*~WATTPAD WARNING!~*~*~*
5  m i n u t e s  l a t e r-
Yeah I kidnapped the child with a battle axe- *sounds from vent*
Mike and Oliver are currently busy. Please come back later and see if they’re available.
Unamused CC noises.
Mike and Oliver have not noticed anything is wrong-
The Pile of Wires decides to try and add Oliver to the kidnapped list.
The Pile of Wires is promptly kicked in the face. Mike and Oliver have gone back to their activities.
The Pile of Wires remembers jumpscares are a thing. *i n h a l e*
The Pile of Wires has been given a warning look.
The Pile of Wires retreats- *planning intensifies*
They go back to enjoying each other’s company.
The AI in Mike’s phone is just watching the chaos.
Plan has been made.
